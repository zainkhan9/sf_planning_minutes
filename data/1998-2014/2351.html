<p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>
<p>I feel that I need to defend the integrity of a few of us on the Commission because of the way insinuations were made at the previous hearing. To set the record straight, 555 Washington was an item that we heard previously and it was an item that we had already continued twice. This is the third time we had set a date for it. One of the commissioners was unable to attend. Previously we had continued an item because there was a desire to see a full commission at that hearing. But I just felt like we had already continued it three times and it wouldnât be good for the public to continue to continue this item. Also, I didnât want to give the public the impression that we were continuing an item to favor a project sponsor and I thought that it could be interpreted that way because I believe that there was at least an insinuation somehow that we were trying to make a move to not continue it in order to somehow disfavor or favor the project sponsor. I just felt that it was long over due and that we needed to hear it. Also, the reason it was being proposed for continuance was because one of the commissioners was unable to attend the hearing. That commissioner in none of my communications with her ever indicated that she was interested in hearing the item continued. The only things we did converse about were her own personal situation that made her unable to attend the hearing. I felt that I really didnât appreciate the insinuation that we were somehow insensitive to the other commissioner who never indicated to me in any of my conversations that she wanted to see the item continued. I donât think that was ever the case. In fact I did at one point before the hearing suggest that we might continue the item given that she wasnât going to be able to attend and we decided no, that the item would just be heard and we take that vote for the public record. I think the Chair did make the right call in deciding to move ahead and schedule that hearing and wait to the call of the item to vote on the continuance. Again, I donât remember seeing anything in writing or hearing anything from that commissioner requesting that that item be continued until they were able to hear it. Also, I just thought it was uncomfortable that a commissioner who when the vote was not to their liking decided to leave the hearing. I just think that frequently we are up here and just because a vote appears to be going in our favor or against our favor, I donât think we should then abdicate our role as a commissioner and just walk because something is going our way or not going our way. I think that is inappropriate. I think it is our responsibility as commissioners to weigh in on all projects and to continue and vote on a project whether or not we feel that we are going to get our way. I find it inappropriate behavior. To each his own. Iâm sure there are several times here Iâve wanted to walk, but I donât because I donât think itâs appropriate. Again, I didnât appreciate the insinuations that we were somehow being insensitive and I wanted to set the record strait that I too had suggested that we might continue it before hand and we decided instead to bring it to the public and to vote it on the record so that the public wouldnât be once again given a reason to suspect that everything that goes on as it relates to planning decisions in the city goes on behind closed doors. To the extent that we can promote transparency, we try to do that here. </p>
<p><b>Commissioner Miguel:</b></p>
<p>Iâd like to mention that in the past week I have met with some people regarding planning of parks in the Eastern Neighborhoods â a very long-range concept. I met with some of the Board and management of St. Maryâs Medical Center regarding their upcoming Institutional Master Plan. I can assure people it will be much simpler than the last medical Institutional Master Plan we heard.</p>
<p>And just a personal announcement that probably has no particular bearing on the Planning Commission, but I have a new title. I am now as of Tuesday night a Great Grandparent. [Laughter and applause]</p>
