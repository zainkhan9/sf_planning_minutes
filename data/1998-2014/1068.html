There had been permits for work done on an alternate address.<br>- The Zoning Administrator reviewed the case file. He realized that the owner had re-designed the building.  The Board of Appeals continued the item for three weeks since the project seemed like a different project.  The Zoning Administrator will examine this project to see if it needs another 311 notice.<br><br>Re:  626 29th Street<br>- This case was heard by the Commission in November.  It also had a variance for a front setback.<br>- There were three buildings in a row that were in the rear yard.  The applicant wanted to build a building in the front and retain the existing single-family development in the rear, remove the kitchen and allow the owner's mother to live there.<br>- The Commission and the Zoning Administrator felt that there was too much opportunity to be two units in a single-family district.<br>- The Board heard the discussion and was sensitive to the concerns the Commission expressed and the concerns the Zoning Administrator had about the rear yard building.  However, they did want to see that the owner remove the kitchen and make sure that there was no direct access to the rear yard building.  They also required a notice-of-special-restriction that would require the building be removed upon the sale of the building or upon death.  <br>- The Board of Appeals continued the matter for three weeks.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of the Commissioner's policy on the demolition of residential structures (unsound housing) <br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>Sue Hestor<br>- There is no staff name on this item.<br>- She has been trying to get documentation on this item.<br>- If there is no staff name it is difficult to get information because there is no one to call.<br>- She is not sure what exactly is being discussed since information is being referenced to items and no one has any documentation.<br>Joe O'Donaghue<br>- He would have liked to see more data regarding this item to know if this policy is justified.<br>- The economic impact needs to be looked at as well.<br>Alice Barkley<br>- This policy addresses only those building which already have a demolition request.<br>- More clarification is needed to make a better analysis.<br>- She believes that more clear criteria should be provided.<br>- Staff should go back and write more clear criteria.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Held.
