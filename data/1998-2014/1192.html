      <p><u>REQUIRED SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS</u> - Ordinance Amending the San Francisco Planning Code to Allow a Required Second Means of Egress <b>Adoption of an ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code</b> by adding a new section 136(c)(4)(A)(i-v) to allow certain stairways that are a required second means of egress under the Building Code, as permitted obstructions in the rear yard. The California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code. This ordinance also includes changes to Section 311 and 312 to require neighbor notification for the addition of these stairways.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Recommend approval of the ordinance to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

      <ul><p><b>Interim Director Macris:</b></p>

      <p>- He introduced Alicia John-Baptiste as the new Chief Administrative Officer.</p>

      <p>Zoning Administrator Reported:</p>

      <p><i>Re:  724-730 Van Ness Avenue (cross Street Turk)</i></p>

      <p>- On June 20, 2002, the Commission approved this project that consisted of 141 units.</p>

      <p>- Project sponsor stated that it would be rental, geared for students, etc.</p>

      <p>- The project was sold to someone else.  The new project sponsor applied for 104 units.</p>

      <p>- He received a letter in August of 2004 that asked the question of whether or not the new project was in general conformity with what the Commission had originally approved.</p>

      <p>- He determined that it was not the same project.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor appealed this determination and submitted a new proposal for 130 units.  This would make it the same type of project.</p>

      <p>- He received an additional letter from the original sender, asking further question about a variety of issues, specifically rental versus for sale.</p>

      <p>- He then determined that the Commission made no mention about rental or for sale (except for the inclusionary housing).</p>

      <p>- The first letter was appealed before the Board of Appeals last night. However, there was a request to have this continued.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Sue Lee:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Schedule something on the Calendar</i></p>

      <p>- When projects have been modified from the Commission's conditional use approval, she requested that they be scheduled before the Commission.</p>

      <p>- The Commission should discuss this in terms of their own action vs. the Zoning Administrator's interpretation.</p>

      <p>- She suggested that this be scheduled on February 3, 2005.</p>

      <p><b>BOA:</b></p>

      <p>- The Board upheld the determination that it was within the bounds of the Conditional Use and did not need to come back.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.

    <p>- He congratulated Commissioner Sue Lee and Commissioner Alexander on their elections as President and Vice President.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  The Permit Process</i></p>

    <p>- There are a lot of problems with the way a permit is obtained.</p>

    <p>- There has been a lot of talk about &quot;undo influence&quot; at the Board of Supervisors and people from the Mayor's Office.</p>

    <p>- It seems that their friend's projects have been put at the beginning of the line and this is unfair.</p>

    <p>- He will be putting forth a ballot measure that would prohibit any member or representative [of the Mayor's office or Board of Supervisors] from contacting any Commissioner about any particular project.</p>

    <p>- This would allow departments to be totally independent.</p>

    <p>- The Board controls the department through budget means.</p>

    <p><b>Francisco De Costa</b></p>

    <p>- He agrees with the previous speaker.</p>

    <p>- The interim Director has a lot to do.</p>

    <p>- There is a lack of environmental impact assessment at the Planning Department.</p>

    <p>- The Commission needs to work very closely with Building Inspection, Redevelopment Agency, etc.</p>

    <p>- An audit should be done on the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Steve Williams - Representing One Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

      <p>- The lot in question does not appear in any of the Sanborn maps.</p>

      <p>- The project does not have a rear yard.</p>

      <p>- The other lot is substandard.</p>

      <p>- The department would have given a different recommendation if staff had had the entire information.</p>

      <p>- This project should be returned for re-analysis.</p>

      <p>- The Building Department reports also gives information that is not correct.</p>

      <p>- There is no need to rush through this project.</p>

      <p><b>(-) William Marconi - 2<sup>nd</sup> Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

      <p>- The project would result in a tiny house and would decrease the value of the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- It would gravely affect the light and views of the house on the southeast corner of Stanyan Street.</p>

      <p>- The project would also result in a loss of open space.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Pennie Sempell</b></p>

      <p>- She lives on Stanyan Street.</p>

      <p>- She was denied vehicle access to her property.</p>

      <p>- She was also denied fire access to the rear of her house.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned about the legality of the construction.  The project will take away a parking area for people that don't have a garage.  The project infringes open space in the area.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Oleg Obuhoff</b></p>

      <p>- He is not against the variance.</p>

      <p>- There are some questions about the true owner of the property.  There has been information that the property was either transferred or sold.</p>

      <p>- Most of the neighbors would like to preserve the open space.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Weill</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Mountain Spring Street.</p>

      <p>- He is opposed to the project because it is out of character with the single family dwelling structures in the area.</p>

      <p>- There is a lot of traffic in the area because of UC Med.</p>

      <p>- The driveway will take away some of the parking.</p>

      <p>- He moved into his home in 1971.  </p>

      <p>- Before 1971, there was construction done to a home and there was water running out of the house.  There is still water running out of the house so he is worried that another construction will make things worse.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Tav Matulla</b></p>

      <p>- She and her husband have lived in the area for many years.</p>

      <p>- She is against the project because it is very massive.</p>

      <p>- There are many issues with this project that need to be dealt with before the project is allowed to move forward.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ted Hlavac</b></p>

      <p>- He is concerned with the project with the same issues as the previous speakers.</p>

      <p>- He is extremely concerned about the negative tactics that the project sponsor has done.</p>

      <p><b>(-) George Matulla</b></p>

      <p>- There are a lot of discrepancies with the reports.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Terry Senne</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Stanyan Street.</p>

      <p>- He joins his neighbors opposing this project.</p>

      <p>- If there was a project that would be built to the detriment of the neighborhood it would be this one.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Cathleen Clark</b></p>

      <p>- She lives in one of the houses of the Stanyan Street steps.</p>

      <p>- She is opposed to the project because there has been a lot of deceit and dishonesty.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned with the destabilization of the hill.</p>

      <p>- There is no vehicular access to their homes.  If this project is built with a driveway it would remove space for people to park their cars.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Leigh Sealy</b></p>

      <p>- This has been on the minds of the neighbors for many months.</p>

      <p>- Open space, parking, nature of the hill, water that rushes down the hill are all the concerns that neighbors have.</p>

      <p>- He would be most encouraged if the Commission would reconsider this project.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Doris Linnenbach</b></p>

      <p>- He agrees with the representative of the Discretionary Review requestor--this is not a simple project.  This project cannot be &quot;rubber stamped&quot; for approval.</p>

      <p>- All the people who spoke would not come here if there were no real concerns.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Dennise Lapointe - Twin Peaks Improvement Association</b></p>

      <p><b>(+) C.J. Healy - Ruben and Junius - Representing Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- This is a very well designed project.</p>

      <p>- This is not a &quot;City giveaway&quot; project.</p>

      <p>- The lot is not substandard.  The lot is about the same size as nearly every lot on Clarendon Avenue.</p>

      <p>- The project meets all the requirements of the Planning Code.</p>

      <p>- The issue of deceit, which was spoken about, is simply not true.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor was very open about everything they have tried to do with the project.</p>

      <p>- The project is actually a very attractive one.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Mark Brand - Project Developer</b></p>

      <p>- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- They have made quite a number of good neighbor gestures.</p>

      <p>- He displayed another diagram showing how the house would not cause shadows to the adjacent house and how the light wells help with brining sun to the house.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Joe O'Donaghue</b></p>

      <p>- The question is that the project is conforming to the code.</p>

      <p>- Parking and open space is an issue of every development no matter what neighborhood.</p>

      <p><u>1598 DOLORES STREET</u> - northwest corner of 29<sup>th</sup> Street; Lots 40 through 52, inclusive, in Assessor's Block 6618 - <b>Request for Conditional Use </b>authorization to modify conditions of approval set forth in Planning Commission Motion Number 16445 as modified by Board of Supervisors Motion Number M02-163 and relating to Planning Department Case Number 2000.1058C to allow payment of an in-lieu affordable housing fee rather than provide on-site affordable housing, pursuant to inclusionary housing policies set forth in Planning Commission Resolution Number 16350. In September of 2002, the City authorized construction of two 4-story buildings on the subject property containing a total of 13 units and up to 26 independently accessible off-street parking spaces; both buildings are now complete. Conditions of approval require one of the proposed units to be provided as a Below Market Rate (BMR) unit. This proposal would modify previous conditions of approval to allow the payment of an in-lieu fee to the Mayor's Office of Housing rather than provide the required BMR unit on-site. No physical work is proposed. The property is within an NC-1 (Neighborhood Commercial Cluster) Zoning District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.</p>
