      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: August 12 Meeting - 170 St. Germain</i></p>
      <p>- The discussion centered on whether or not there 
        was an accurate representation by the project sponsor's advocate or by 
        the advocate for the Discretionary Review requestor as it related to the 
        status of the building or compliance with DBI applicable codes. An assertion 
        was made by the DR requestor's advocate that the project sponsor's representative 
        misrepresented the condition of the building as it related to compliance 
        with DBI and that the Commission possibly based it's decision on this 
        misrepresentation.</p>
      <p>- He has had time to review the record more closely. 
        This is a serious assertion and he would like to make sure that this was 
        followed up on. In the event that that is not accurate since the record 
        clearly states that there was no misrepresentation in the case, when Mr. 
        Jeremy Paul stated that the building owner had taken a out a second permit 
        related to interior finish, and that the building was not in violation 
        as a result of this second permit. This was an accurate representation. 
        He would like the record to show that Mr. Paul accurately presented the 
        condition of the building at that time.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">BOS</font></p>
      <p>- The Full Board actions for this past Tuesday:</p>
      <p>1) The Board passed on first reading the ordinance 
        to amend the Section 312. The Board took out all the amendments that the 
        Commission had previous made. This ordinance reduces notification for 
        certain changes of uses that do not involve new construction, demolition 
        or exterior alterations to a building. The Commission's amendments to 
        the ordinance was to restore to the full 30 day notification certain changes 
        of uses that were considered to be 15 days.</p>
      <p>2) The Board also approved an interim ordinance on 
        the demolition of single and dual screen movie theaters for a period of 
        45 days. This ordinance was sponsored by Supervisor McGoldrick and co-sponsored 
        by Alioto-Pier. This matter did not come before the Commission but it 
        will appear on the agenda on November 21 when the Commission reviews a 
        permanent ordinance by Supervisor Peskin that amends the planning code 
        that would require a conditional use for change of use or demolition of 
        a movie theatre.</p>
      <p>3) There was an introduction by Supervisor Maxwell 
        of a resolution imposing for a 12 month period interim zoning controls 
        for lower Potrero Hill and Showplace Square. The Commission is scheduled 
        to consider the issue of land use controls for the Eastern Neighborhoods 
        on October 28.</p>
      <p>4) The appointments of the Mayor to the Planning Commission 
        were continued and will be heard on October 19, 2004.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">The Rules Committee</font></p>
      <p>- Held a hearing on the powers of the Zoning Administrator.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Zoning Administrator commented:</font></p>
      <p>- He gave a status report on 724 Van Ness Avenue.</p>
      <p>- He recommended that there not be a hearing on this.</p>
      <p>- He may not have handled his responses to the Commission 
        as smoothly as he could have because he was perceived as &quot;arrogant.&quot;</p>
      <p>- The BOS wanted to have a hearing on the rules and 
        powers of the Zoning Administrator.</p>
      <p>- It is very important to try to keep the issues of 
        the project separate.</p>
      <p>- Ultimately, the item was continued.</p>
      <p>- He has placed in the Commissioner's correspondence 
        folder a copy of his decision for this particular project.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner S. Lee:</font></p>

Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. </p>
