        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  5 de Mayo</i></p>

        <p>- She wished everyone a happy &quot;5 de Mayo&quot;.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Jean Paul Samaha (former employee of the Planning Department)</i></p>

        <p>- She wished him a happy birthday.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>6. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Landmark's Board</i></p>

        <p>- They approved landmark designation for St. Brigit's Church.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Emporium/Bloomingdales</i></p>

        <p>- Commissioner Olague had requested information on this project.</p>

        <p>- The Landmarks Board had a hearing on this and the tape is available.</p>

        <p>- Unless there is a strong desire from the entire Commission to bring it before them, the project status will remain with the public comment heard at the Landmark's Board.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Case Reports</i></p>

        <p>- There are standard case reports on the computer system.</p>

        <p>- After speaking to staff, there was a consensus that these standard case reports are too complicated [to access].  He has spoken to the computer support staff and has asked that they make these standard case reports easier to access.</p>

        <p>- There will be a checklist type system implemented as well so that all the reports are more consistent.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>BOS - None</b></p>

        <p><b>BOA - </b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  1234 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- The Commission denied this demolition.  The Commission was overruled +5-0.  The appeal for the new construction was continued to June 5, 2005 so that project sponsor can work with the department on the new design.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  2123 Jersey Street</i></p>

        <p>- This was a merger and your decision was overturned +5-0.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>D. GENERAL</b> <b>PUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

    <p><b>(did not state name) - SPEAK</b></p>

    <p><i>Re:  1234 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue - Heard at the Board of Appeals</i></p>

    <p>- She wants to know what is the policy when something is referred to the Board of Appeals?</p>

    <p>- What happens with the case report and the findings that the Planning Commission issued?</p>

    <p>- Isn't anything said at the Board of Appeals?</p>

    <p>- Although this was a contentious case, there is a point to be made at the Board of Appeals by Planning staff so that the desires of the Planning Commission are transmitted.</p>

    <p><b>David Sasson - US Navy</b></p>

    <p>Re:  Various Items</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Board of Appeals</i></p>

    <p>- Section 9, Provisions Governing the Board of Appeals states, &quot;It is the duty of the department to forthwith scrutinize same and within three days notify the Board of Appeals of the people who appeared on the case...&quot;</p>

    <p>- This is a serious problem because the Commission has lost many cases.</p>

    <p>- Until the joint hearing with the Board of Appeals, there are about five cases that will be turned down because the Commission's information is not transmitted to the Board of Appeals.</p>

        <p>- He submitted plans for the previous construction and received the over-the-counter permit and completed the project.  He was shocked to receive a termination of this permit.</p>

        <p>- He then tried to rectify it and was allowed to continue the work.</p>

        <p>- He wanted to preserve the exterior of the home but maximize the interior as much as possible.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Resolution - Item 23f:</i></p>

    <p><b>Chris Durazo - SOMCAN</b></p>

    <p>- She is concerned about a few issues:  She feels the $3.00 fee as a citywide impact fee for open spaces is just a PR piece; She feels the first resolve should be eliminated and the second one should be revised.</p>

    <p><b>George Westlake - Archdiocese of San Francisco</b></p>

    <p>- Many of the parishes have been working for many years for more affordable housing in the City.</p>

    <p>- This resolution is the right step in that direction.</p>

    <p><b>Ken Warner - Trinity Plaza Resident's Association</b></p>

    <p>- This resolution does no good for people who cannot afford to buy a home in San Francisco.</p>

    <p><b>April Veneracion - SOMCAN</b></p>

    <p>- It is important to emphasize that Rincon Hill is a broader South of Market community.</p>

    <p>- The impact fee should be directed specifically to the South of Market.</p>

    <p>- On the last paragraph:  If a Mello-Roos is pursued, the cost savings to the developer should be based on the local impact fee.</p>

    <p>- Commissioner Sue Lee requested sites for affordable housing.  She would like to see that information discussed today.</p>

    <p><b>Barbara Long - Senior Housing Action Committee</b></p>

    <p>- They adopted the platform for the South of Market.</p>

    <p>- The South of Market Seniors have asked for jobs and housing for them - this could be added to the resolution.</p>

    <p>- The community stabilization fund should be in the control of the South of Market area and not used throughout the city.</p>

    <p><b>Calvin Welch - Council of Community Housing Coalition</b></p>

    <p>- There is no date certain in the fourth paragraph of the resolution.</p>

    <p>- The Commission should stipulate a specific date when the mitigations are to be decided upon.</p>

    <p><b>Judith Baker - South of Market Child Care</b></p>

    <p>- Her organization has adopted the community platform.</p>

    <p>- She is glad that there will be first-source hiring, but housing also is very important.</p>

    <p>- The mitigation measures should benefit the South of Market.</p>

    <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>

    <p>- There needs to be major improvements in the area.</p>

    <p>- If the housing burden is shifting in the South of Market, then there should be improvements in the area as well.</p>

    <p>- The Commission needs to communicate all this to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

    <p><b>Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Residents Association</b></p>

    <p>- The surrounding areas should benefit from the development impact fees.</p>

    <p>- The affordable housing should be inclusionary.</p>

    <p>- Funds should go to the Rincon Hill and immediate South of Market area.</p>

    <p><b>Diego Sanchez - South of Market Community Coalition</b></p>

    <p>- They hosted a meeting with planning staff.  It was mentioned at the meeting that the impact fees could go as high as $25.00.</p>

    <p>- It would be great to get that extra &quot;chunk!&quot;</p>

    <p>- It is important to go back to the drawing board and find out where the $25.00 is.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  On the various proposed project actions listed below - items 22 and 23a-e:</i></p>

    <p><b>Douglass Perry - Construction and Building Trades Council</b></p>

    <p>- He hopes that these projects are approved as well as the ones in the pipeline.  This will provide much needed housing and much needed jobs.</p>

    <p><b>Theodore Brown - Project Sponsor for 375 Fremont Street</b></p>

    <p>- He thanked staff and the Commission for getting his project in the pipeline.</p>

    <p><b>Brendan Donagan - Architect</b></p>

    <p>- He has two projects in the area.</p>

    <p>- Allowing 375 and 399 Fremont to go forward is the right idea.</p>

    <p>- This way there will be more housing instead of less.</p>

    <p><b>Chris Durazo - SOMCAN</b></p>

    <p>- She urged the Commission to look at the issue of cumulative impacts in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- These towers will be high density.</p>

    <p>- She urges the Commission not to pass the EIR.  It will come back again if the issues are not dealt with.</p>

    <p><b>Barbara Long</b></p>

    <p>- This is a very important moment for San Francisco.  It will open the doors to different building developments for wealthy people.</p>

    <p><b>Glenn German </b></p>

    <p>- He is disappointed with how the night is going right now.</p>

    <p>- The Commission is taking a disenfranchised community and hurting it further.</p>

    <p><b>April Veneracion - SOMECAN</b></p>

    <p>- She is very disappointed and encourages the Commission to revise the previous conversation or not pass the plan.</p>

    <p>- Supervisor Maxwell was in support of their platform.</p>

    <p>- She hoped that the Commission would send a strong message and not have to go through the Board of Supervisors.</p>

    <p>- There are tremendous City benefits to this plan and they should be implemented.</p>

    <p><b>Mike Thereau</b></p>

    <p>- He thanked staff for this plan and their efforts to include pipeline projects in the plan.</p>

    <p>- He looks forward to moving on to the next steps.</p>

    <p>- There will be much needed money brought to the City.</p>

    <p><b>Jim Salinas</b></p>

    <p>- He is glad that all of the issues have been &quot;washed&quot; out.</p>

    <p>- He thanked staff for having incorporated the pipeline projects into the plan.</p>

    <p>- There are critical housing needs in this City.</p>

    <p><b>Michael Alexander - San Francisco Beautiful</b></p>

    <p>- They support this plan but also want the Commission to look at the long-term affects of it.</p>

    <p>- There are always going to be people who will ask for exceptions.</p>

    <p>- The opportune time to say &quot;no&quot; is now.</p>

    <p><b>Greg Miller</b></p>

    <p>- He thanked staff for allowing the pipeline projects to be included.</p>

    <p><b>Robert Meyers</b></p>

    <p>- The pipeline projects are consistent with the Rincon Hill plan.</p>

    <p>- This would allow for much needed housing to begin right away.</p>

    <p><b>Ken Warner - Trinity Plaza Tenants Association</b></p>

    <p>- How many people read his article in Beyond Chron regarding Rincon Hill?</p>

    <p>- If the Commission votes yes to certify the EIR, people will take it to court.</p>

    <p><b>Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Tenants Association</b></p>

    <p>- He has made suggestions to improve the plan and one of those would be to not include the two projects on Fremont Street.</p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission to do what is fair for the residents of the Rincon Hill area.</p>

    <p><b>Jeffrey Libovitz</b></p>

    <p>- There are a few exciting projects going on in the area.</p>

    <p>- It is important to see the needs of the South of Market.</p>

    <p>- Improvements are needed in the infrastructure, community developments, etc. in the South of Market.</p>

    <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>

    <p>- She requested no pipeline exceptions.</p>

    <p>- 60% rental is even high.  Families that exist in the South of Market will be eliminated.</p>

    <p>- Low-income people have kids.</p>

    <p>- The EIR is not based on a real world.</p>

    <p><b>Azalia Merrill - Carpenter's Union</b></p>

    <p>- As a mother of three and a native San Franciscan she appreciates the comments for affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Affordability can be sustained by projects.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that pipeline jobs are allowed to go through instead of pausing them and causing for rates to rise.</p>

The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase height limits, revise the &quot;R&quot; bulk district, amend the Rincon Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood. The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks.</p>
