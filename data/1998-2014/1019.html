<p><b>A. SPECIAL CALENDAR</b></p>

<div style="MARGIN-LEFT: 2em">
<p><font face="Arial"><u>EASTERN NEIGHBORHOODS BRIEFING AND INFORMATIONAL PRESENTATION ON LAND USE OPTIONS</u> - Informational presentation and public hearing to consider the various land use options resulting from the workshops of the Community Base Planning Process for the Eastern Neighborhoods. This will be an opportunity for interested parties to contribute to the formulation of a preferred zoning option for each of five neighborhoods, including Bayview Hunters Point, Mission, Showplace Square/Potrero Hill, South of Market, and Visitacion Valley. No action will be taken at this meeting.</font></p>

<p><b>SPEAKER (S):</b></p>

<p><b>Don Watson</b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">At the Edge of Bayview Hunter's Point there is a Labor/Unionist community that is working in Islais Creek to create a historic park that includes a coper crane. This was from the coper ships that came to Islais Creek around 1984. We would like to preserve it as a maritime/blue collar project.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- He would like some housing built on the south side of the creek.</font></p>

<p><b>Robin Chiang, President Friends of Islais Creek</b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-We have been working hard to keep vandalism away from this area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- For the past several months we have been dealing with homeless encampments.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- Asked the Planning Commission to consider extending the little transit village from 3<sup>rd</sup>&#160;Street over to Islais Creek so there would be permanent residents to keep the place up; or perhaps it could be turned into a mixed use PDR.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Langston G. Sclocum Sr.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Working to return the Bayview Hunters Point Neighborhood to a predominantly single-family residence area with low density, and making parking essential in our area.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The new Master Plan for high-density housing is being opposed throughout the whole southeast section.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Shirley Moore</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Spoke regarding the lightrail and the liability of the shops and businesses on 3<sup>rd</sup> Street.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">At this juncture lightrail is coming through. It will resurrect 3<sup>rd</sup> Street. There are 84 businesses and shops on 3<sup>rd</sup> Street, and it is imperative that these businesses remain viable and accessible by auto traffic during construction.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Francisco Da Costa</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In planning for the City and County of San Francisco we need to keep in mind the commercial vacancy that is all over the City.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We cannot build more housing in areas where there is a lot of pollution.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In the Hunters Point Neighborhood, 65% of the people own homes. The rest rent--just the opposite from the rest of the City.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Planning is good, and building housing is good, but we need to improve the quality of life here.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is not good to have housing very close to the so-called "dirty business." By dirty business I mean the concrete company. There is a lot of dust from this company.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is not good to have families living near by.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Andrew Bozeman,</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Commended the Commission for allowing the public to express their concerns.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Pollution is a very high concern in the area.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">People who move into housing that is close to this business are being taking advantage of.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Open space, beautiful space where you can relax is something that is at a very low level in the Bayview.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Ron Morgan</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Asked the Commission to include the Bernal Heights neighborhood when considering planning changes along Bayshore Boulevard.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Steve Vettel</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Of the three alternatives being discussed today, only one reflects the objectives and the planning that went into the concept plans. That is Alternative C, the higher housing alternative. What the concept plan did was come up with five activity notes on Bayview Hunters Point: four in the area along 3<sup>rd</sup> Street, and one that is out on the Isslais Creek.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Option C was developed to reflect the concept plan very well.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Height limits are only 50 feet in this area. We are not talking high-density high-rise housing, but moderate scale housing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Eve Bach</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Expressed concerns about doing zoning just at the point when a redevelopment plan is on track for adoption. The Redevelopment Plan will override the zoning.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is not clear to us what is accomplished by putting in new zoning at all. Once the redevelopment plan goes into effect, the zoning will have no impact, not if the redevelopment plan for Hunters Point is the same as any other redevelopment plan in the City that overrides the zoning. Why are you doing this? And will this have a shelf life of more than a year?</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">There is very strong desire to have a very strong commercial sector with small businesses in place. Where Big Bucks has come in other cities, even established small businesses have had a hard time competing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Bob Craft</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- This district is really growing and is very active.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Asked the Commission to keep the area affordable for everybody.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Chris Witteman</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">As a resident of Bernal Heights he did not receive any kind of notification that there would be any planning process in the area.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial"><b>Julia Viera</b>,</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">What you see on Third Street has no relationship to the surrounding hard working middle class, urban suburbia that is populated by folks who urgently want a town center that is inviting, safe, and accessible.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- We do not want a canyon of potential slums.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Pauline Peele</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Would like to maintain the positive part of the Bayview, while we enlarge and support with better shopping along the new Third Street corridor.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Do not raise the height more than 40 feet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Also concerned about parking.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Barbara Kyle</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is really important that any planning for Bernal Heights include the people who live there.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Encouraged the Commission to remove from the maps any reference to what is called PDR Large Commercial because that really is a Big Bucks development.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Tim Shinner</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">He did not get any notification about any rezoning/planning in the Bernal Height neighborhood.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Make neighborhood streets more pedestrian friendly.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Asked the Commission to consider how they can tie this rezoning of the area to the traffic issues common both in Bernal Heights as well as Bayview Hunters Point? This could be something of value to his neighborhood instead of a negative thing with more traffic and more Big Bucks stores that many of us are not in favor of.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Martha Bradigan</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Regarding Bayview: People who have lived there for many years are being displaced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Expressed concern about loosing a large number of industrial and auto repair shops in the South of Market area.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Need to preserve the residential in South of Market by keeping those height limits where they are.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Craig Freeman</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Concerned about the height limits and parking requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is not realistic to have one unit of parking per residential unit because in most situations there are two or three cars per unit.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Luther Greulich</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Concerned that there is no zoning category exclusively for medium and light industrial.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Small and medium size businesses are being squeezed out of the City by the fact that housing is moving in.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Nancy Boas</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Agreed with SPUR, that this plan is counter-productive.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Urged the Commission to give SPUR's economic team a serious opportunity to be heard because they have some good ideas.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Many of the neighbors were not notified, so the neighborhood reports are not necessarily representative of the entire community.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Gutta Reichert</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In support of Option C in the South of Market, which adds more housing and commercial.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Anthony Faber</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In opposition to the plan in the South of Market.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Jim Haas</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">South of Market is not one large homogeneous district. The east area is different from the central area around 6<sup>th</sup> Street where a large group of Filipinos live, which is different from the west area which has a different mix of residences, retail uses, and so forth.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The planners need to go back to the South of Market and meet with the neighbors from 6th Street, the people from the east area, as well as the people from the west.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Jason Ortega</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In the South of Market, developers will start building around our properties. This process will result in eviction notices or an increase in rent because of the pressures the landlords will get from developers.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We oppose the plan and demand that they go back to the community and do community planning the right way.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Louise Bird</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In the South of Market, she supports Plan B, which is moderate housing and moderate PDR.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Jeffrey Libowitz</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Thanked the Planning Department for bringing together the workshops that were well attended by the South of Market neighbors.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Recommended that height limits remain as they are.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">When the Planning Department sets out to work with the neighborhood to maximize housing production, it does an excellent job. We saw this in the Market-Octavia Better Neighborhood 2002 Program, in which there is rezoning for housing on private land.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Arial">- Unfortunately the Eastern Neighborhood Rezoning process started out with exactly the opposite goal. Instead of trying to make the neighborhood more livable and instead trying to solve the City's housing crisis, the Department started out with an assumption that the vast majority of the City's historical industrial land must remain zoned for industry at a time when there are millions of square feet of historically zoned PDR in the City that is simply vacant.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">An no time has there been any credible study to determine that there is a demand for land zoned for PDR; that there will ever be any demand for this land; and if the land is so zoned that the uses will come, or that the jobs will be well paid, or even that the jobs will go to San Franciscans.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The Department's zoning for SOMA and the Mission in particular will represent a step backward for the City. The Showplace Square Plan is perhaps the most forward-looking proposal. Even though here height limits are too old to effectively make use of the land for housing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">SPUR urges the Commission to consider the three following actions: 1) First of all, assure that there is money to complete the environmental review of the Market-Octavia Better Neighborhood Plan and the Balboa Park Better Neighborhood Plan; 2) wherever feasible, choose the height housing option; and 3) wherever land is rezoned for housing in historically industrial area, make sure the height limit is at least 85 feet.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In the actual book that was handed out, there are multiple maps of the plan area with different boundaries. When I talked to staff about it, I realized that they are really over-worked and just would like to encourage the book; that all plan area boundaries (would) be roughly the same. The same is also true when you look west of 10<sup>th</sup> Street, because part of that area was an overlap--again with the Better Neighborhood 2002 process.

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">He noted a couple of things from the staff presentation: 1) when talking about residential they rely solely on ABAG to come up with the housing estimates and what is required for San Francisco. When it comes to PDR, they rely on their internal calculations. I would request that they use sources such as the Society of Industrial and Office Realtors, the Urban Land Institute, and/or SPUR to get some reliable numbers, because the stuff they concocted over many months ago was really written before they even started the workshop process and it hasn't changed; and 2) furniture showrooms are medium PDR and not comparable with housing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Concerned about the height and land use in the design district. This district has many large block buildings, many of which are up to 85 feet in height. The new structure should follow that context and strengthen the historic scale and character of the area. 85 feet allows for the construction of more housing. 40, 50, and 65 feet obviously allows for less housing. 85 feet is not tall enough to block views. Views are already blocked by the future Mission Bay with buildings that will be up to 120 feet tall. The freeway is over 65 feet.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Buildings near 7<sup>th</sup> Street should 85 feet tall. Taller height along the freeway and adjacent to Mission Bay is not unreasonable.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">It is a better urban solution to an abrupt drop in height.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Wider streets required taller buildings to create appropriate street wall proportions. San Francisco is urban, not suburban. Indeed, some of the most famous San Francisco neighborhoods have height walls.</font></font></p>

The affordable housing units alone represents a direct subsidy from the developers of nearly $36,000,000. The 1450 new households would bring nearly $100,000,000 of annual disposal income to the City-- money that would otherwise be expended elsewhere.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">When I talked about the Design District, I talked about the area that is at the base of Potrero Hill in the Design District.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The Design District has developed over the last 20 years into an area of many design businesses and institutions. One that has, I might add, many design, not PDR jobs, that are well paying jobs. The City Planning Code recognized the distinct nature of this area over a dozen years ago and created the Showplace Square Special Design District. That code section, which was passed in 1988, states that the " Design District there was intended to facilitate the transition of the Showplace Square Area, from its former industrial character to an area of design showrooms. The showroom type activity enhances the Showplace Square Area, and attracts investments, developments, and other designs improvements."</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The stakeholders that you have heard today, combined with the codes specific zoning in 1988, illustrates that this is no longer an industrial area. Moreover, this is an area where housing is not just appropriate, but is necessary for the continued vibrancy of this neighborhood and the design uses that are within it.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The stakeholders that you have heard today have participated in the community planning process. They happen to know this area intimately and have been in the area, many of them, for over 20 years. Their vision for this area is consistent with the voices that they heard repeatedly in the community planning process. Housing is not only compatible with the design uses that already exist, but housing is complementary to them.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The notion presented by the Department today, that of design and furniture showrooms, is medium PDR, and therefore incompatible with housing. I would suggest respectfully that it is also inconsistent with the indisputable facts that are found in other design district worldwide. It is even inconsistent with the code that was passed in 1988.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">This neighborhood is an ideal location for the development of housing. Housing that will create the critical mass necessary to support the many amenities this community wishes to see in this area -- such as transit, open space, retail, and the safety of a 24 hour-a-day dynamic neighborhood.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Our plan allows for about 2500 housing units, which is what Option A proposed in the last workshop that we attended. Now it has jumped to 3800 on the website and the handouts tonight.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">There is a lot of development pressure in the Potrero Hill area and we are concerned about that.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The map that we worked on, contained many compromises between developers, residents, transit concerns and needs, and concerns expressed by the Boosters. We feel this is a better compromise than the other proposal. We feel that this plan should be consider by you very seriously as we continue this process.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Kate White</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Her primary concern is based on ABAG projections, and the difference between projections and need.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The Draft Housing Element takes a good look at the original housing needs using ABAG produces. Projections are based on existing zoning and what they sort of think will happen.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">If we really want to shape development we really should look at need. What your Housing Element looks at is a cost for 2700 units annually.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In term of Showplace Square, we feel Option C, the height housing, really makes sense, particularly for this neighborhood. The Mission and SOMA are areas where Option B makes more sense.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Fritz Maytag</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Urged the Commission to think about the fact that there is inherent conflict between residential and industry. It is fundamental.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Industry requires capital and long-term financial commitments. If you give industry a zone we will take it.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Don Adams</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Commended the Planning Staff for their efforts in their review of the conditions of the Eastern Neighborhoods.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">There is a need for housing, in particular family housing, which is affordable to moderate and low income people.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Industrial land represents some good opportunities for development such as housing.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We need to be strategic when rezoning industrial land to allow housing. Especially as optimal conditions for each are sometimes in conflict. Industrially zoned parcels that are to be converted to mixed use should be selected carefully.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Rezoning land to more intensive use confers additional value to the land owner and the developer. That is were the rezoning for housing and mixed use has been appropriate. It is reasonable public policy to demand a higher threshold of public benefit in exchange for the added land value that confer to the land owner.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">By public benefit uses, I am referring to uses that are beneficial to the neighborhood and City at large as affordable housing, larger family housing, PDR space, and public open space.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Desiree Almendral</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The Planning Department presentation was a result of the of the community demands to be included in this process.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Our goal is to remind people that the planning process is not about codes, development, or money. It is first and foremost about us, the people.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In addition to the Planning Department's workshops, MAC held workshops to familiarize the community with the planning process. We conducted surveys of peoples wants in the community, and surveys for land use changes in the Mission.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">People are concerned about the lack of industrial jobs and affordable housing. You will hear about necessary steps that we must make together--the Community, the Planning Department, and you, the Commission, in order to proceed with the planning process in the Mission.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Please respect the process that has included the valuable time of the Planning Department and the people of the community. Do not disregard the work that has already been done. Include the people's plan and integrate it into the process. The EIR must start immediately. We must move forward not backward.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Bill Murphy</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Roselyn (unclear last name)</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We need affordable housing</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We need you, the Planning Commission to take their recommendations seriously, and plan for the community, by the community.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">(-) Ada Chan, MEDA/MAC</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The people planning process involved 100 if not a 1000 participants in the neighborhood.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We actively engaged the community in thinking about the issues that we're going to be faced with in the planning process.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Do we believe that PDR are important? Yes</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Do we believe that Land Zoning is necessary to protect those uses? Yes</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">What do we feel are our needs for housing? We do believe in housing, but we believe there is need for affordable housing. This is not just a belief, it also shows up in the housing element that just recently came out.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">If a transitional land use is going to occur, if we are going to loose working class jobs, and industrial PDR jobs, we want housing and development, and businesses to be develop in those areas that serve the working class people in our community.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The people's plan is very similar to the Planning Department's Option B--which 75% of the people who attended community planning meetings support.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">If development occur in these areas, we would loose the small-independently owned businesses, auto repair, contractors, plumbers, etc. What will come up in their place? The kind of housing that will result because of the lot size would not be affordable.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Kyle Fiore</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Asked the Commission, that until the permanent controls are set in place in the Mission, to take care when making decisions based on strategies that will protect the integrity of the Northeast Mission Industrial Zone as an economically affordable and viable district for businesses devoted to production, distribution and repair.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">20% of the office space outside the financial district, lies now unoccupied. Industrial occupancy and rent in the northeast Mission continue to be high.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The light industrial size furniture manufacturer, small wholesale enterprisers, auto and other repair shops in the zone, provide literally thousands of entry level and blue collar jobs accessible to the Mission immigrants and working class population.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Times New Roman">-</font></b> <font face="Arial">Production, distribution, and repair space in the Mission is imperative.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Chris Terroso</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">According to the housing element, 56% of San Franciscans are low to moderate income.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">City projections indicate that in the next five years, with the existing zoning, we would be over built in market-rate housing, which serves those earning well over 120% of medium.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In order to meet citywide housing goals, 2 out of 3 of all housing built must be below market rate.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Eric Quezada, MAC</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">I believe that a lot has been done. This process tonight is indicative of how difficult it is to carry out a planning process, a community-based planning process.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">What is before you now is that we need to preserve PDR. We do this by providing new opportunities for housing that meets the communities needs and goals.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">We do not need to continue to build extremely expensive housing that very few people can buy or rent, particularly those who live in the Mission District. Why do we continue to develop this type of housing?</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">At some point in the near future you will have to make a decision. And the question is, if we are not ready to go forward with the EIR, why should they put a project before you to move forward?</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">You need to take into account what has been done in the community, what is being said in the community, and the history of the last few years, when those projects come before you.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">There is a lot potential to work out some plans with developers and with the community, so the community benefits. The threshold is to meet everybody's goals, not just the developers, and not just a small percentages of San Franciscans or others that can afford to live in that type of housing (market-rate).</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Charlie Sciamas, MAC</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Asked the Commission to include very strong community benefit standards for the long term zoning controls they will be adopting.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The project at 2690 Harrison Street lies in an area that is squarely in the middle of the Mission Industrial Zone. It is also in an area where neighbors and residents, through the community planning process and the people's plan, have identified an area that makes sense to transition from industrial use to housing. This transition does come at a cost because good living wage jobs are been eliminated. We should have higher standards for housing that will come in their place. This standard should address the day-to-day struggles of residents and workers in the Mission. For example, there should be a higher number of affordable units, more family size units, deeper affordability to insure that low income and very low income residents of the Mission also get access to new housing, and also permanent affordability to insure that tenants are not displaced down the line to market rate conversions.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Chris Zelig</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Spoke about the importance of the interim controls and also the need for good policy, between when IPZ expires--at the beginning of July, and the implementation of permanent controls.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Oscar Grande</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">People need industrial jobs, accessibility, diversity, and a living wage. People need family affordable housing that is stable, decent, and ample. People need strong communities, culture, traditions, and prosperity.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The longer this Commission takes to move forward the Mission rezoning proposals, the more our community becomes powerless and our actions meaningless. The longer you take, the more back room deals are cut with money interest and with personal agendas, the more the community looses faith in our Planning Commission.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Curtis Eisenberger</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">PDR is inconsistent. The definitions of PDR varies from district to district. It is unfair. It is based in large measure on faulty data and incomplete data.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Mark Snyder</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">If you take all these blocks of businesses and eliminate them as suggested in Option C, there will a tremendous loss of jobs.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Property owners in the NEMIZ have spent millions of dollars refurbishing former factory buildings that were setting empty. They now have hundreds of small businesses that generate more jobs and income for the City than the factories ever could have.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Fred Snyder</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The NEMIZ is the only neighborhood that the Planning Department has ever tried to rezone; and that took place in 1992-1994. It was a community process.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Biotech was the big buzz word then. Now we are going to go Biotech only. Everything else will become nonconforming.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Thomas Shuen</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">PDR is production, distribution and repair within existing infrastructures that can not move a 40 foot container around, and with the environmental requirements any of these production facilities could survive to mix with the residential area. Furthermore, San Francisco is the high labor area. Mixing this idea is not realistic.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Secondly, when you do the development of a building you also create jobs. They are San Francisco's jobs. We have to look at things realistically and plan a way that everybody in the City could benefit.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Bill Murphy</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Believes that the people's plan for the private sector can accomplish the affordable housing goals in the following manner: 1) eliminate controls over the number of units and instead look to FAR, height and setback limits, and rear yard requirements to level the playing field among different uses--similar to Rincon Hill and Downtown Planning Concepts; 2) exempt designated public benefit uses from being counted in the FAR--light industrial, community or cultural facilities, and childcare are targeted and are prioritized in the community planning process; 3) promote design flexibility within the building envelope in order to increase the ability of new development to provide increased community benefits; 4) provide bonus FAR and additional lot coverage and/or height for inclusion of designated public benefits; 5) provide additional development as a ratio of affordable housing density bonus benefits with this proportional benefit for larger units to serve the high proportion of families in the Mission.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Milton Gaines</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Urged the Commission, Dr. Ghosh, and Director Green to please listen to the input from the Mission Coalition for Economic Justice and Jobs.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Phil Lesser</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Asked the Commission to keep in mind the needs of the people that live in the Mission.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Supervisor Chris Daly</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">In 1977, he was evicted from his apartment in the Mission District.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">From 1995 until the Board of Supervisors passed the Interim Controls in the Mission District, this Planning Commission was at war with the neighborhood. Land use was one of the most contentious political topics in this City--always has been and probably always will be.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">There was wholesale displacement affecting seniors, immigrants, families with kids, small business, and mom and pop businesses in the neighborhood that predominantly impact the Latino working-class.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Interim Controls are up very soon. The new State law preempts the Board, in all likelihood, from passing an extension to those interim controls. As many of the speakers from the Mission expressed here tonight, it is up to you now. It is up to you to decided whether you once again declare war in name to the new coalition in the Mission District--a front group for property owners who are looking to maximize their profits.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">All the people that came to all those meetings, packing the O'Connell High School, the Planning Commission meetings--those are the people that are watching for their bottom line. It has nothing to do with money. It has do with their families, kids, businesses, livelihood, and integrity of the neighborhood.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">And, if you declare war again on the Mission District, I have confidence in the community and neighborhood. That they will fight back and will defeat you.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">David Dempsey</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">The northeast side of the Mission is a neighborhood that over the last twenty years blacks, Latinos, gays, whites, business people, artists, just a great many people, have invested their hearts and soul to turn this into the most compelling little neighborhood in the United States. A destination neighborhood for people to come and see what we have done in it.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Times New Roman">-</font></b> <font face="Arial">The only reason that MAC and MEDA want to take us out is because they are jealous of our success.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><b><font face="Arial">Amie Fishman</font></b></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Is PDR space necessary? Why is it coming back? One of the things we've seen is that PDR was pushed out by skyrocketing rents. And why is that land not filled again by new PDR business? Because the landlords are sitting and speculating, waiting for the highest and best use to come through.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">- <font face="Arial">Zoning is really crucial. It has to go beyond the economic bubble and booms and buzz. If we do profit driven planning, everybody will loose.</font></font></p>
