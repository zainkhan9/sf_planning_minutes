        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Ordinance from Board of Supervisors</i></p>

        <p>- There was an ordinance passed which requires self-breathing replenishment systems in high rise buildings for permits issued after March 30, 2004.</p>

        <p>- There seems to be some question about when this ordinance will be implemented.</p>

        <p>- He will contact DBI to get more information because this could be applied to the Rincon Hill projects.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Letter from Ms. Azalia Merrill</i></p>

        <p>- She did an extensive search for below market rate units.</p>

        <p>- How are below market rate units being noticed?</p>

        <p>- How are people chosen to qualify for these units?</p>

        <p>- How does one verify the income level of the people that are chosen?00</p>

        <p><i>Re:  399/375 Fremont Street</i></p>

        <p>- His feeling is that the Commission expressed an interest that an Environmental Impact Report reflects the possibility that if a one tower option is analyzed that the impact could be analyzed up to a height of 450 feet.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- She call for a public hearing on this project.</p>

          <ul><p><b>Commission Secretary responded:</b></p>

          <p>- Any Commissioner can make a request, but if the request does not come from the Commission President, then she needs to have a consensus of the other Commissioners on the matter.</p>

        </ul><p><b>Commissioner Hughes:</b></p>

        <p>- The plumbing expert stated that when a few of the units were flooded during the rains, it was because there was something wrong with the architecture and the plumbing.</p>

        <p>- By approving this project, it would allow construction by a negligent builder.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- This was a very controversial project.</p>

        <p>- The developer made a statement that the neighborhood did not want a &quot;poor unit&quot;.</p>

        <p>- The money that is being offered, is money that does not match the affordability of the unit.</p>

        <p>- The Commission should allow an Inclusionary unit at this project site.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Disapproved</p>

        <p>AYES: Alexander, Antonini, Bradford Bell, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee, Olague</p>

        <p>15. 2005.0128U (M. CORRETTE: (415) 558-6295)</p>

        <p><u>1886 MISSION STREET</u> - west side between 14th and 15th Streets, Lot 003 in Assessor's Block 3547 -  <b>Appeal of Inner Mission North survey findings</b>  - Following the Landmarks Boards' Public Review Process for Cultural Resource Survey findings, the Planning Commission must review written objections to the Inner Mission North Cultural Resource Survey Phase II (California Department of Parks and Recreation Survey Forms - DPR 523A and 523B) survey findings as presented by property owner.  The Commission is requested to evaluate the owner's objection to the proposed California Historic Resources Status Code (CHRSC) assigned to the property at 1886 Mission Street.  It should consider and adopt a resolution to either: 1) endorse the evaluation and the CHRSC rating that found the property to be individually eligible for the California Register (3CS), <i>or</i> 2) determine, based on historical evidence and evaluation criteria, an alternate CHRSC status code.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt a resolution upholding the evaluation and Status Code of 3CS as recommended by the Landmark's Board.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Merits of the Project</i></p>

        <p><b>(-) Brett Gladstone</b></p>

        <p>- Planning Staff issued a negative declaration previously on this building.</p>

        <p>- In 2004, the revisions to the project were done, the Landmarks Board designated the building as historic.</p>

        <p>- A rating of 6L means that it should be on a City and State survey but should not be categorized with a historic rating.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Augustine Faxon</b></p>

        <p>- It has been five years since he started with this project.</p>

        <p>- The intent is to have affordable housing and to have community space for the neighbors to meet.</p>

        <p>- He will be able to train the youth of the Mission to work on this project.</p>

        <p>- It is worth keeping the history but not to designate it as a landmark.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Warner Schmalz - Project Architect</b></p>

        <p>- He displayed various pictures of buildings that are old but would not be designated as a Landmark.</p>

        <p>- They are similar to the subject project.  </p>

        <p>- The project was built with poor quality materials and badly constructed.</p>

        <p>- The history of the subject building is in the labor units that met there and not into its architecture.</p>

        <p>- The history of the building will be maintained in pictures and statements that will be displayed in the lobby of the building.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will vote similar to the vote of the 2000 Commission and not designate this site a Landmark.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Roberta Gavino</b></p>

        <p>- She is a member of the Carpenter's Union.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will allow the developer to construct affordable housing at this location.</p>

        <p>- There is nothing historical about this building.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Ruben Santana</b></p>

        <p>- He made an evaluation report on the well being of the project.</p>

        <p>- The building is not something that anyone would want to maintain.</p>

        <p>- The building should be demolished and a properly engineered structure should be constructed.</p>

        <p>- He grew up in the neighborhood and has seen the area not progress at all.</p>

        <p>- He would like to have this area progress.</p>

        <p>- This is just another &quot;white elephant.&quot;</p>

        <p><b>(-) Michael Davos</b></p>

        <p>- This project was not designated a Landmark when the project came before the Commission a few years ago.</p>

        <p>- This building should just be demolished.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission votes to not designate it a Landmark.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Carmen Perez - Spoke through a translator</b></p>

        <p>- This project could bring many benefits to the neighbors.</p>

        <p>- This project will allow a community space for the residents of the area.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Sofia Ayala - San Francisco Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</b></p>

        <p>- She read a letter from the president of the Chamber requesting that the Commission not give this building with a historic rating.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Phillip Lesser - President of the Mission Merchant's Association</b></p>

        <p>- Everyone in the Mission is at a loss as to why this building would even be considered a landmark.</p>

        <p>- There are wonderful buildings in the area.  If this building was an attraction he would totally be in agreement with land marking it in order to continue the beauty in the Mission, but it is not.</p>

        <p>- The building is only a crime magnet.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Gus Murad</b></p>

        <p>- He lives and works in the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- He walked around the building and it is really in a bad shape.  </p>

        <p>- He cannot see the historic significance for it or setting a high rating value to it.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Nick Aiello - Senior Vice President of the Mission National Bank</b></p>

        <p>- He has been in the banking business in the Mission for 30 years.</p>

        <p>- Everyone in the Mission is wanted and needed by the residents of the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- It should not take four years to make a decision on this building.</p>

        <p>- He has been in the building and there is nothing historical there.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Milton Gaines</b></p>

        <p>- He has been in business for 35 years in the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- He feels that this is a judgment call.  Many people feel that it is a historic building and many people believe that it is not.</p>

        <p>- He feels that this building should not be designated historic.</p>

        <p>- This area is an area in the Mission that needs the most improvements.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Fred Snyder</b></p>

        <p>- He appreciates the presentation made by staff.</p>

        <p>- He is not sure if this designation is a way to stop construction in the Mission Street.</p>

        <p>- The building is rundown and dilapidated and should be demolished.</p>

        <p>- The project that is being proposed would clean up the neighborhood tremendously.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Will Smith</b></p>

        <p>- Even if the money was found to restore the building, there is no point in fixing it if it is going to sit empty.</p>

        <p><b>(-) John O'Brian</b></p>

        <p>- He was born in the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- He is in favor of the project because it will create affordable housing and jobs for the building trades.</p>

        <p>- He is shocked that someone would suggest designating this a Landmark.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Jose Moreno - Housing Action Coalition</b></p>

        <p>- The building has no historical significance as far as he is concerned.</p>

        <p>- The project will add much needed housing and tax revenue.</p>

        <p>- The Housing Action Coalition voted to [demolish this]. </p>

        <p><b>(+) Tim Kelley - Landmark's Board President</b></p>

        <p>- They have gone through a process of evaluation of this building.</p>

        <p>- The Board voted unanimously to recommend this building to be designated a Landmark.</p>

        <p>- A historic resource is a category under CEQA that represents the quality of a building.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Kate White</b></p>

        <p>- The site has no architectural merit, according to Heritage.</p>

        <p>- She appreciates that the owner has improved the project but it is not very well designed.</p>

        <p>- The proposed project will improve the area greatly.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Erin Grucz - San Francisco Architectural Heritage</b></p>

        <p>- She urged the Commission to uphold the designation by staff.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Rosario Anaya - Mission Language and Vocational School</b></p>

        <p>- She is here to support Mission Gardens, which is a project that will be a gateway to the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- It is very encouraging for the community to see a project that will allow possible homeownership.</p>

        <p>- The developer has done his due diligence by seeking community input.</p>

        <p>- She asked the Commission to not allow a historical value of this project and allow a developer to improve the building.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Toby Levine</b></p>

        <p>- She has been a resident of the Mission for about 38 years.</p>

        <p>- She lives in a Landmark building.</p>

        <p>- This building is a very simple, uninteresting, old and rundown building that has no architectural merit.</p>

        <p>- It does have its historical merit--but that is all.</p>

        <p>- The Landmarks Board is advisory to the Commission where the decision rests.</p>

        <p>- It is time to give it the right category and allow the project that everyone wants.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Lamar Baker</b></p>

        <p>- He is a member of the Carpenter's Union.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- There is a lot of support for a replacement project.</p>

        <p>- This item is not about the project but about the process.</p>

        <p>- This is not saying that the project cannot be built.</p>

        <p>- She appreciates the various staff reports.</p>

        <p>- The environmental document should just be done.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Dale Watson</b></p>

        <p>- She is a carpenter.</p>

        <p>- The building is only going to be a target for crime.</p>

        <p>- This building should just be demolished and allow for an affordable project.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Kinn Sean Webber</b></p>

        <p>- He has not seen the building but can understand everything that is being said.</p>

        <p>- When a building is conditioned for housing, it allows for people to live there peacefully.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Azelia Merrill</b></p>

        <p>- She is a native San Franciscan and belongs to the Carpenter's Union.</p>

        <p>- This building is not contributing to the culture of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The building has acquired a lot of mold.</p>

        <p>- She does not see any merit to designate this with architectural value.</p>
