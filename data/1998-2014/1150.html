<p><b>A. CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>The Commission will consider a request for continuance to a later date.  The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.</p>

    <p>1. 2003.1110T                                                                   (I. WILSON: (415) 558-6163)</p>

      <ul><p><u>REQUIRED SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS</u> - Ordinance Amending the San Francisco Planning Code to Allow a Required Second Means of Egress; Adoption of an ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by adding a new section 136(c)(4)(A)(i-v) to allow certain stairways that are a required second means of egress under the Building Code, as permitted obstructions in the rear yard. The California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code. This ordinance also includes changes to Section 311 and 312 to require neighbor notification for the addition of these stairways.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Recommend approval of the ordinance to the Board of  Supervisors.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>7. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <ul><p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods </i></p>

      <p>They received two pieces of correspondence: one from Supervisor Gonzalez regarding the Eastern Neighborhoods and most specifically the NEMIZ Industrial Zone, the other from Jim Meko regarding the boundaries of the South of Market.  These questions had been raised by other Commissioners.</p>

      <p>- With the feed back that she has received, she feels that it is important to reopen the Eastern Neighborhoods hearing before moving forward.</p>

      <p>- She asked the present Commissioners to give her their opinion and then open the hearing again.</p>

      <p>- She does not want staff to feel &quot;beat up on&quot; but she would like to meet with staff as soon as possible.</p>

          <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Feldstein Responded:</b></p>

          <p>- She feels that there is a need to reopen the hearing on the NEMIZ.</p>

          <p>- She would like to see that as soon as possible.</p>

          <p>- She requested a copy of any correspondence regarding this item to all Commissioners.</p>

          <p><b>Commissioner Sue Lee:</b></p>

          <p>- She agrees with reopening the hearing to look at this item as a whole.</p>

          <p><i>Re:  Personnel Matter:</i></p>

          <p>- She wants to know what progress has been made regarding an employee who is also working for the City of Berkley.</p>

          <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

          <p>- He also received the letter from Supervisor Gonzalez.</p>

          <p>- If the consensus of the Commission is to reopen the hearing, he would be willing to participate.  He is not to much in agreement but he would be willing if the Commission agrees to reopen it.</p>

      <ul><p><b>BOS - </b></p>

      <p>Full Board of Supervisors Hearing of March 23, 2004:</p>

      <p>- He represented staff and the Commission regarding the Formula Retail legislation.</p>

      <p>- He expressed to the BOS staff's concerns about our ability to implement the formula retail proposals.</p>

      <p>- The BOS was cognizant of staff's concerns.  Some of the Supervisors recognized that this might not be a perfect ordinance but the ones that voted in favor of it felt that it served the purpose of providing notice of formula retail.  The Supervisors voted +8-3 (Supervisors Hall, Ma and Alioto-Pier voted against the proposal).</p>

      <p>- From a staff point of view, the Supervisors heard our concerns about the work load issue and that Section 312 in many ways was duplicative and would create an extensive work load.  Formula retail would overburden staff.</p>

      <p>- There will be a meeting this afternoon with Supervisor Gonzalez's staff regarding this.</p>

      <p>- There is word that Supervisor Gonzalez will introduce amendments to revoke the pharmacy and coffee shop provisions of Section 312 immediately.</p>

    <ul><p>10. 1999.0233E (B. WYCKO: (415) 558-5972)</p>

      <ul><p><u>833 - 881 JAMESTOWN AVENUE</u> - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. </b> The project sponsor proposes construction of a Planned Unit Development (PUD) that would consist of 198 one-, two- and three-bedroom market-rate condominiums on an approximately 6.9-acre lot, located at 833-881 Jamestown Avenue on Assessor's Block 4991, Lot 277, on the northern slope of  Bayview Hill.  The site is currently used as an overflow parking lot for events at Candlestick Park, which is approximately one-third of a mile southeast of the project site.  The site is bordered by Jamestown Avenue (and single-family homes on the north side of Jamestown) to the north, another vacant lot to the east that also is used for parking for major events at Candlestick Park, the hillside to the south, and single-family housing to the west.  Although the area proposed for development is mostly flat, development would require excavation of up to approximately 30 vertical feet at the base of the hill.  The project would consist of 11 separate three- and four-story buildings:  seven buildings of 12 to 18 units each along Jamestown Avenue and four buildings to the rear, at the base of the hillside.  Of these latter four structures, two (36 units each) would be built atop one-story gated parking garages, while smaller buildings (one of eight and one of 10 units) would flank the garages.  A total of 216 independently accessible parking spaces would be provided.  The proposed project would include landscaping along Jamestown Avenue, construction of a 10-foot-wide sidewalk, two off-street freight loading areas, and about 28,900 sq. ft. of common open space, including two rear yards at the base of the hillside totaling about 7,250 sq. ft. and podium- and ground-level patios.  The project also would remedy an existing drainage problem on Bayview Hill above the project site, on Recreation and Park Department land.  The project site is located within the South Bayshore Plan area, in an RH-2 (Two-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  As a PUD, the project would require review and approval by the City Planning Commission pursuant to Sections 303 and 304 of the Planning Code.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ralph D. House - Bayview Hill Neighborhood Association</b></p>

      <p>- This development will have a severe impact on the livability of the area.</p>

      <p>- The overall effect of the project will degrade the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The support of this project comes from an area that already contains public housing.</p>

      <p>- In the last ten years many families have moved away from the City.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Jim Reuben - Representing the Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- Many of the conditions stated in the Appellants report were already there and will continue to be there.</p>

      <p>- The City's entire environmental team is here to answer any questions.</p>

      <p>- He displayed a chart showing the EMR sale prices for this project.</p>

      <p>- The project will create a number of homeowners.  He does not understand how this could be something negative environmentally or for the community.</p>

      <p>- This project is considered low density in the South Bayshore Plan.</p>

      <p>- The project has been redesigned in the last years.</p>

      <p>- He submitted various letters of support.</p>

      <p>- It is hard to imagine a more appropriate project for a location that contains just gravel.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Alan Martinez - Project Architect</b></p>

      <p>- He displayed a map of the area and photographs of how the lot looks now.</p>

      <p>- The intent of the plan was to design the project as typical San Francisco housing.</p>

      <p>- He displayed a rendering showing the architectural aspects of the homes, showing facades and landscaping.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Charles Cleary - Candlestick/Bayview Hill Neighborhood</b></p>

      <p>- Originally, the lot had not been divided into two.</p>

      <p>- It has now been divided and zoned into two lots.</p>

      <p>- A builder has presented to them 198 units stacked on top of each other without giving any type of density report.</p>

      <p>- The negative declaration does not have a traffic study or an estimate of the number of cars.</p>

      <p>- How does one know that the impact of a building will be if there has not been a complete environmental report.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Kathleen Cleary</b></p>

      <p>- She spoke in opposition to the project in its present form.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned about maintaining the quality of life in their neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- She requests that the project be reduced in density and reduce the number of units. </p>

      <p><b>(-) Ellouise Patten - Young Community Developers</b></p>

      <p>- There are several young members that have to get up by 5:00 a.m. to try and find work.</p>

      <p>- She had about 20 people stand up from the audience.</p>

      <p>- The developer has not tried to establish a contract with the workforce of the area.</p>

      <p>- She respects the developer and the contractor.  But it is disrespectful that they have not tried to contact the several agencies that provide workforce.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Owen Guan</b></p>

      <p>- He has lived on Jamestown Avenue for many years.</p>

      <p>- There is already a traffic problem in the area.</p>

      <p>- There are many people who have several cars.</p>

      <p>- If the project would be revised to be less dense, many of the residents would be in support.  It would be a good idea to make the units with less bedrooms or smaller square footage.</p>

      <p><b>(-)Timothy Simon</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Jamestown Avenue.</p>

      <p>- He has had several people come to his home to meet and deal with the issues.</p>

      <p>- One of the issues that is critical to the quality of life for residents is that there have not been enough people to discuss safety.</p>

      <p>- There is a need to have member representation at the discussion boards.</p>

      <p>- Mr. Murphy has agreed to these principals but has not agreed for purposes of the Commission.</p>

      <p>- It is important to go back to the table.</p>

      <p>- The data is stale for this project.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ted Douglas - Bayview Hill Neighborhood Association</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Jamestown Avenue.</p>

      <p>- The first time he moved into the area, he heard gunfire in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- If there was an emergency situation, it would be difficult for emergency vehicles to get by.</p>

      <p>- He would like to see the density come down.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ralph House</b></p>

      <p>- There have been four PUDs completed in this neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- One has to be careful when considering what to build because people are going to be spending a lot of money on the homes.</p>

      <p>- The hill is not stable.  It would be important for the hill to be stabilized completely before approving this type of project.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Shirley Moore - Candlestick Point/Bayview Heights Committee</b></p>

      <p>- She lives in the area.</p>

      <p>- Since March 4, there have been meetings with the developers regarding this massive project.</p>

      <p>- A development like this would seriously alter the character of the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- There are already seven hundred approved units ready to be constructed.  Only a few have been sold because of the problems of traffic and the issues related to the infrastructure of the community.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ruth Callas</b></p>

      <p>- She has lived on Jamestown for about 25 years.</p>

      <p>- The traffic in the area has slowly gotten worse.  A project like this will only create more chaos.</p>

      <p>- She does not believe that the area would change with a project like this.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Nancy Stevens</b></p>

      <p>- She has lived on Jamestown Avenue since 1992.</p>

      <p>- She is opposed to the Negative Declaration because the area cannot handle any more cars.</p>

      <p>- She welcomed everyone to her house on a Sunday during game day.  She is trapped in her house on those days.</p>

      <p>- This has been going on for several years.</p>

      <p>- A project like this would only impact the traffic even more.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Lansgton Slocum - Bay View Hill Neighborhood Associates</b></p>

      <p>- He has been living on that hill for about 50 years.</p>

      <p>- There has been very little development for the last 30 years.</p>

      <p>- The Commission should hear what the people of Jamestown are asking or saying.  People in the area own single-family homes and not high-density unit buildings.</p>

      <p>- All the way around there is dirt and he does not believe that people in the area are very concerned about this dirt.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jay Bradshaw - Carpenter's Union</b></p>

      <p>- There are too many units in the area. </p>

      <p>- He feels that the quality of this project will not be good.</p>

      <p>- The Carpenter's union is willing to hire many of the Young Community Developers to train them and give them the opportunity to find good quality jobs.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Curtis Senega</b></p>

      <p>- He read a letter from Cederick Jackson who is in support of this project.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Linda Richardson</b></p>

      <p>- They have developed a comprehensive concept plan that actually utilizes high density and open space.</p>

      <p>- There cannot be this type of project without a comprehensive plan.</p>

      <p>- She supports this project.  The Commission's approval should not close the door to the developer.</p>

      <p>- It is important to look at the housing needs.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Lupo - Carpenter's Union</b></p>

      <p>- He is not in support of this project because there are no jobs for the future.</p>

      <p>- There is nothing in writing.</p>

      <p>- He has not seen any permanent jobs for any of the members of the African American community.</p>

      <p>- There has been no attempt to contact the Young Community Developers to provide them an opportunity for jobs.</p>

      <p>- There should be an opportunity for apprenticeships.</p>

      <p>- He is interested in knowing what the affordability is.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Manuel Flores</b></p>

      <p>- Is this project affordable?</p>

      <p>- This project does not provide anything in writing relating to jobs, training, unions, etc.</p>

      <p>- He is opposed to this project.</p>

      <p>- He has not seen this developer higher members from the African American community or Latino community to provide jobs.</p>

      <p>- He is a 22 year resident of the area.</p>

      <p>- Right now there are issues of traffic, security, etc.</p>

      <p>- Has there been enough study on what would be the affects of this project on the current residents of the area?</p>

      <p>- Every day will be game day if this project is approved.</p>

      <p>- The parking that will be displaced on game day will intensify an already bad situation.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Ron Miguel</b></p>

      <p>- He is here as Chair of the Housing Action Coalition</p>

      <p>- The idea of a mix of single family and multiple family units works.</p>

      <p>- There are various public transportation systems there including the Third Street Light Rail.</p>

      <p>- Regarding the parking, this issue should be dealt with completely as well.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Kate White - Director of the Housing Action Coalition</b></p>

      <p>- She is very pleased that the 12 percent of affordable units proposed on site.</p>

      <p>- The project will be one block from the Third Street Light rail and the project will be finished around the same time as the Light Rail system.</p>

      <p>- She appreciates the time that the project sponsor took to discuss issues with the Housing Action Coalition.</p>

      <p>- She urges the Commission to support this project.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Holly Ames</b></p>

      <p>- She lives on Jamestown Street.</p>

      <p>- She feels that this project should be reduced in size.</p>

      <p>- Development in the Bay View is fine if it is a project that fits with the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- It is disconcerting to see that in the Executive Summary the Planning Department has a rebuttal for all of the issues expressed to them.</p>

      <p>- This project is about four or five blocks from Third Street and not one block as mentioned by the previous speaker.</p>

      <p>- There are several problems in the area and she feels that people will not buy these units too easily.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Espanola Jackson</b></p>

      <p>- She lives three blocks from Jamestown Street.</p>

      <p>- Regarding training, people have been trained to death but there are no jobs.</p>

      <p>- She believes that her community does not get the same services as other areas.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Deven Richardson</b></p>

      <p>- He read a letter from George Newcort who had to leave early but is in support of the project.</p>

      <p>- Regarding massing, the project has changed several times to address this concern.</p>

      <p>- She is an architect and a Planner.  She believes that the problems with this project are the 49er's games.  Something more should be done about public transportation.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Arelious Walker - Senior Pastor of the True Hope Church in Christ</b></p>

      <p>- In connection with the Housing Authority, they have been able to provide housing for many people.</p>

      <p>- He was impressed with the quality of staff from the Planning Department.</p>

      <p>- He feels that this project has met all the requirements.</p>

      <p>- This is a tremendous project.</p>

      <p>- At some point during this project, it would be important to talk about employment.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Kathy Bermingham</b></p>

      <p>- She is a teacher and lives in Petaluma.</p>

      <p>- She cannot afford to live in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- This project sounds as if it will be affordable to people like her, allowing us the opportunity to live in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- She understands people's concerns about traffic.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Jesse Baldain - Embassy Realty</b></p>

      <p>- He supports the project since it will provide jobs and housing to the community.</p>

      <p>- There is no basis that this project should be delayed.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Coy McAllister</b></p>

      <p>- This project should be implemented.</p>

      <p>- This area has not been developed since he was a child.</p>

      <p>- Now there is someone who will develop this area sooner or later.</p>

      <p>- All the issues have been looked at.</p>

      <p>- There are many issues that are not specific to this project.</p>

      <p>- This developer is providing less density than what is allowed.</p>

      <p>- This project needs to be approved as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>- The developer lives in the community so he is not coming from another state.</p>

      <p>- The developer has also held and attended several community meetings.</p>

      <p>- The Carpenter's Union has worked long and hard so that all carpenter's make decent wages in decent environments.</p>

      <p>- This is the only thing that they are worried about.</p>

      <p>- She cannot work with any developer that does not have good working conditions for their workers.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Roger Ryan</b></p>

      <p>- He supports the project.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor has taken out 12 units to reduce the density.  This is almost like &quot;shooting yourself in the foot.&quot;</p>

      <p>- He knows the project sponsor and knows that he will employ locally.</p>

      <p>- This area of town is affordable for everyone.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor had 30 meetings with the local residents.  He has been more than accommodating.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Dick Millet</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Potrero Hill.</p>

      <p>- He is finding that this project should be a &quot;no brainer.&quot;  It is a little bit too small. There should be more units there.</p>

      <p>- He knows that Bay View is zoned single family but this project is a good contribution to the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- On the waterfront the Commission just approved doubling the height limit of high rise towers and this is not that high or dense.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Elizabeth Moore</b></p>

      <p>- This project is an opportunity and a test.  It is an opportunity to implement the smart growth and the sustainable development principals that are repeated over and over in every single document guiding land use policy in this City including the General Plan, the South Bayshore Area Plan and the Planning Code.</p>

      <p>- It is a test of whether the analysis and conclusions of legions of experts, months and years of discussions and debate among city policy makers like yourselves, and pages and pages of City policy have all been for nothing. Or, a test of whether the city can put it's money where it's money is and actually act to implement it's excellent planning policies.</p>

      <p>- Due to the delays and changes, the cost of the project has skyrocketed.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Bryan Malone</b></p>

      <p>- He came to San Francisco about 23 years ago.</p>

      <p>- This project should be approved because it will allow affordable units to be on the market.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor needs about 250 square feet for her art work which is very large in size.</p>

      <p>- This is a potentially affordable unit, but the policy of encouraging small affordable units is outweighed by other Commission policies and General Plan policies.</p>

      <p>- This proposal is to restore the space to the original historic use.  The area not lived in would be for artist space.</p>

      <p>- If the project sponsor is allowed to do this merger she will apply for a listing in the California Historical Resources Survey to promote it's long standing historical use.</p>

      <p>- The unit in question has been vacant for the last 15 years.</p>

      <p><b>(+) B.J. Frederickson - Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- There have been tenants living in the space below but she had to evict because the house needed major repairs and the person could not live there during the renovation.</p>

      <p>- She never rented the space again because first she intended for her mom to live there but unfortunately she passed away before that could happen.  Then she decided not to rent anymore because the previous tenant had complained about late hour noises she made trying to finish her art work.</p>

      <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this merger so she can continue to produce her art.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Marge Williams</b></p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted. </p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(+) Mimi Molian - Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- The purpose of the addition of the stairwell is to connect approximately 370 square feet of basement space to the unit.</p>

      <p>- She wants to accommodate her mother who will be moving in with her.</p>

      <p>- There is no sun or light issue involved because the roof of the addition will be below the window sills of her property and her neighbors.</p>

      <p>- She did not purchase the property for it's aesthetic value.</p>

      <p>- Since much of the stucco is being removed, she thought it would be an opportunity to add another finish to the exterior of the building. </p>

      <p>- She met with the Telegraph Hill Dwellers and they ensured her that they were not going to contest the project.  Since then they have changed their mind.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Robert Smiley - Robert Smiley Associates - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

      <p>- The DR requestor is concerned about egress and life safety.</p>

      <p>- There is an exit that should not be blocked according to code.</p>

      <p>- He requested that the roof line be sloped or add some type of parapet.</p>

      <p>- Regarding the drain in front of the stairwell, he would like to be ensured that it will be moved and the concrete all around be re-done to make sure that there is no water leakage or damage.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Gerry Crowley - Telegraph Hill Dwellers</b></p>

      <p>- There is a letter from the telegraph Hill Dwellers Association that expresses  their concern about the changes in the facade of the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- If the proposed exterior is permitted it will stand out like a &quot;sore thumb.&quot;</p>

      <p>- The type of finish and quality of the building materials must be compatible with those used in the surrounding area.</p>

      <p>- When using this type of material, close inspections should be required to make sure they will be applied to the building correctly.</p>

      <p>- It is best to use the same materials.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the project.</p>

      <ul><p><u>2760 DIVISADERO STREET</u> - southeast corner of Divisadero and Green Street: Lot 020 in Assessor's Block 0953 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2003.05.02.3712, proposing to: (1) construct a new two car garage at the Green Street frontage; (2) expand an existing second-floor sunroom by enclosing an existing rear deck, and; (3) install a clear glass wind screen at the perimeter of the third floor front deck in an RH-1 (Residential, House, One-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  <b>  </b></p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jim Lazarus</b></p>

      <p>- He requested from the Commission take Discretionary Review because the project will cause light, air and view impacts on the DR requestor's home.</p>

      <p>- There was previous construction on the subject property but through negotiations and compromises, both owners were able to deal with the issues.</p>

      <p>- This addition will be unsightly and will be difficult to view.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to take Discretionary Review and require that the rebuilt of the sunroom in the rear not exceed the current footprint of the sunroom and the windscreen in the front not be constructed west of the westerly side of the existing chimney.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Elizabeth Funk, Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- The first concern that her neighbors have is the windscreen.  The windscreen they want would make the deck much safer for their toddler and it would protect them from the San Francisco wind.  The windscreen will be made out of a glass type material so it will not block her neighbor's view.  It is also made out of a self cleaning glass, which is more expensive, but this way it will minimize their  view issues.</p>

      <p>- The addition we are proposing will have less of an impact than other additions that have been built in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The second aspect is the rear sunroom at the back of the house.  There is an already existing deck which was enclosed many years ago.  They are proposing to finish enclosing the deck.  The enclosure would be glass and because it is on the north it would not block sunlight to the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- This particular area is not particularly significant.  They are proposing to do something a little more significant to maintain aesthetics.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Carol Potts</b></p>

      <p>- She read a letter from a neighbor who is in support of this project but could not attend the hearing.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Motion to not take Discretionary Review and approved the project.</p>
