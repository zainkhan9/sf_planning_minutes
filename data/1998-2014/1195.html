    <ul><ul><p>4. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <ul><p><b>Commission Secretary:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Minutes</i></p>

      <p>- Because she has had to oversee Department Administration and Commission matters for a few months, the minutes for Planning Commission meetings have been delayed.</p>

      <p>- Since the new Chief of Administration position has been filled, she will be able to concentrate just on Commission matters.</p>

      <p>- She will be submitting minutes as soon as possible.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Death of her nephew</i></p>

      <p>- She thanked the public for their support and condolences for the death of her nephew.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Planning Commission not being televised</i></p>

      <p>- She asked why the Commission would not be televised.  She had the understanding that the money to pay for being televised came from funds from the Department of Building Inspection and not the General Fund.</p>

          <ul><ul><p><b>Interim Director Macris responded:</b></p>

          <p>- He is not sure why either but he knows that the Commission Secretary will be researching this information.</p>

      </ul></ul><p><i>Re:  Stan Warren</i></p>

      <p>- She would like to adjourn this meeting in the memory of Stan Warren.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Rincon Hill</i></p>

      <p>- One of the objectives of this plan was to set aside workforce housing.</p>

      <p>- This is a real critical issue.</p>

      <p>- Much of the work force has been excluded.</p>

      <p>- It is important to find some kind of solution to address this problem.</p>

</ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>5. Director's Announcements</p>

      <ul><p><i>Re:  Budget</i></p>

      <p>- They had a very good session regarding the budget.</p>

      <p>- He will provide a budget draft this week and will probably have it delivered by hand.</p>

    </ul><p>6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

      <ul><p><b>BOS - None</b></p>

      <p><b>BOA - The Zoning Administrator reported</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  23 Eureka</i></p>

      <p>- This case was heard by the Commission.</p>

      <p>- The project consists of a very small cottage that was being raised five feet to use the lower floor.  He granted a Variance for this and it was upheld +4-0.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  1244-1268 Sutter Street (Old Regency Theatre)</i></p>

      <p>- There was a proposal to use the building as a fabric design studio.</p>

      <p>- There were a lot of people working on computers so he determined it was more of an office activity.</p>

      <p>- The board overturned him +3-1.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Harding Theatre</i></p>

      <p>- He does not remember that this building still had the configuration of a theatre.</p>

        <ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator Responded:</b></p>

        <p>- There are some significant features that are original to the theatre.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>7. Informational presentation of currently proposed changes to the First Congregational Church project at 1300 Polk Street, northeast corner at Bush Street, Conditional Use authorization of Case 2002.1010C, approved by the Planning Commission on July 31, 2003.</p>

      <ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>Tod Kimies</b></p>

      <p>- He displayed a rendering of the redesign of the church and gave general architectural details of the project.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Informational Presentation Held.  No action required or taken.</p>

</ul></ul></ul><p><b>D. GENERAL</b> <b>PUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

      <ul><p><b>Jackie Brison</b></p>

      <p><i>525 5<sup>th</sup> Street</i></p>

      <p>- There have been a number of complaints about this building.</p>

      <p>- This is supposed to come before the Commission eventually.</p>

      <p>- She was ejected from the shelter.  She is a disabled person and the building is not ADA compliant.</p>

      <p>- The process is too slow so if worse comes to worse; she will shut down the building.</p>

      <p><b>Ernestein Weiss</b></p>

      <p><i>Re: Meetings not televised</i></p>

      <p>- She is concerned about the meetings not being televised.</p>

      <p>- This is the most important Commission as far as she is concerned.</p>

      <p>- She also wanted to know if a director had been chosen?</p>

      <p><b>Charles Marsteller</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue</i></p>

      <p>- It is his view that a Conditional Use and a Variance does not exist for the building that the project sponsor intends to build:  130 market-rate and BMR condominiums with 52 parking spaces.</p>

      <p>- This bait and switch project subverts the integrity of the Conditional Use process and sets dangerous precedents for others to follow.</p>

      <p>- They still believe that the Planning Commission should recall this project for public hearing.</p>

      <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Avalon Ballroom/Regency Theater</i></p>

      <p>- She is concerned that the Zoning Administrator does not submit documents to the Planning Commission.</p>

      <p>- If the definition of office is not preserved or identified, then the City Attorney should provide that information.</p>

      <p>- She is really troubled by this.</p>

      <p>- She requested that the Commission schedule a new hearing on this matter.</p>

      <p><b>Joe O'Donoghue</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Planning Commission not being televised</i></p>

      <p>- It is very important to have the Commission televised.</p>

      <p>- He knows that there are funds to cover the costs of being televised.</p>

      <p>- He feels that the Mayor has been getting bad advice.</p>

      <p>- It seems like this is just censorship.</p>

      <p><u>787 BRANNAN STREET (aka 785 BRANNAN STREET; aka 100 GILBERT STREET)</u> - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration - </b>The proposed project is the construction of a five-story, approximately 50-foot tall, 29,653 gross-square-foot (gsf) residential building with 56 single room occupancy (SRO) units.  The ground floor would contain a lobby, a manager's office, a community room for the residents and 8 SROs.  The second through fifth floors would include 12 SRO units on each.  No off-street parking or off-street loading would be provided.  A 900-square-foot roof deck would be provided as common usable open space meeting the requirements of the Planning Code.  The project site is 6,124 square feet in size and currently used as a 20-space surface parking lot, located on the northeast corner of Brannan Street and Gilbert Street in the South of Market District.  Pedestrian access to the building lobby and the community room would be through one door mid-lot on Brannan Street.  All of the units would be rental units designated as permanently affordable to households with income not exceeding 50% of the City's median income. The project site is zoned SLI (Service Light Industrial) and is within a 50-X height and bulk district.  Conditional Use authorization is required for SRO units in the SLI district, and parking, rear yard, and permitted obstruction variances would be required for the proposed project.  </p>

      <p>- She has been given several plans so she is a bit confused.</p>

      <p>- She has been given documents that have been &quot;whited out&quot; and then written over.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned with the garbage cans that will be left on the street.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Sue Hestor</b></p>

      <p>- There is no parking control in the area so this is an environmental issue.</p>

      <p>- The environmental documents need to deal with reality and not standards.</p>

      <p>- The City has been lax on putting signs up in the area.</p>

      <p>- The analysis of parking problems in this document is not accurate.  Garbage is an environmental issue.</p>

      <p>- The 20-day notice for the Conditional Use has been ignored.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Lupo - Capenter's Union - Local 22</b></p>

      <p>- He knows the real problems of traffic in the area but this document seems to ignore them.</p>

      <p>- He knows several businesses that have left the area because of the parking situation.</p>

      <p>- Instead of a roof deck there should be real open space.  The unit in the back could be eliminated.</p>

      <p>- Maybe the amount of required housing could be reduced.</p>

      <p>- He has been a resident of the area for four years.</p>

      <p>- There are a lot of parking problems on that street.</p>

      <p>- Recently a restaurant was approved and it has caused more traffic in the area.</p>

      <p>- There is also a trash problem in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Scott Krager</b></p>

      <p>- He has been in the neighborhood for many years.</p>

      <p>- When the Hall of Justice was built, they did not provide any parking in the area.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Bruce Wineberg</b></p>

      <p>- He has been in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The project will affect negatively the neighbors because of shadows.</p>

      <p>- Land has always been an issue.</p>

      <p>- He does not believe that in an SRO building there will be tenants with too many cars.</p>

      <p>- There are many SRO buildings that do not have trash all over the place.</p>

      <p>- This project is a very good project and will add to the community.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Barton Devirsion</b></p>

      <p>- He has owned a business in the area for the last six years.</p>

      <p>- There are actually about 30 parking spaces being lost.</p>

      <p>- The businesses were there first and there should be some consideration.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Timothy Rose</b></p>

      <p>- He is representing the tenants of a building in the area.</p>

      <p>- There are no windows on the east and west side of the building.</p>

      <p>- Covering the windows will get rid of half of the light into the units.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Randy Shaw - Director of Tenderloin Housing</b></p>

      <p>- They work very well with the people on Gilbert Street regarding the garbage.</p>

      <p>- Their only concern was that they did not want more garbage trucks come through this small street creating more noise and traffic.</p>

      <p>- The building next door is not a residential building.</p>

      <p>- There is not that many people that own cars.</p>

      <p>- These are studio apartments and not SROs.</p>

      <p>- The entire project will have people that quality to live there if they have lived in an SRO for more than one year.</p>

      <p>- It is unfortunate that [some of you believe that] people that live in SRO units are people that will be going through garbage cans.</p>

      <p>- This is an opportunity to expand their housing program to the homeless.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Valery Simpson - General Manager of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic</b></p>

      <p>- There are people that live at the hotel and she hears them speak about moving into a studio apartment.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Anthony Faber</b></p>

      <p>- He is in favor of the project.</p>

      <p>- This is a great project.</p>

      <p>- It is difficult to live in an SRO because a bathroom has to be shared.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Bill Murphy</b></p>

      <p>- He is a former SRO tenant. He is currently at a shelter.</p>

      <p>- He needs a place that is not dingy, dark, with an elevator that does not work, etc.</p>

      <p>- Most SRO tenants do not want to stay there all their lives.</p>

      <p><b>(+) James Collins</b></p>

      <p>- He was a former tenant of a residence hotel.</p>

      <p>- For he and his neighbors to have their own bathroom and kitchenette was a great thing.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Meredith Walters - Central City SRO Collaborative</b></p>

      <p>- All she hears about is how much people living in SROs want to move into their own apartments.</p>

      <p>- It means a lot to have a bathroom and a kitchen.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Otto Duffy</b></p>

      <p>- He lives in a residential hotel.</p>

      <p>- He has spent considerable time at this location.</p>

      <p>- He has spoken to the adjacent neighbors and after much dialogue had full support from them.</p>

      <p>- The problem with parking is caused by the Hall of Justice.</p>

      <p>- A lot of the garbage issues are just excuses to not have low-income people living in the area.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Joe O'Donoghue</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on McAllister and knows of garbage noise from the garbage trucks and people getting cans and bottles out in order to sell them.</p>

      <p>- This buildings should be well designed that will send Mayor Newsom's program of Care not Cash forward.</p>

      <p>- People who use a wheelchair should be able to have access to their building, but it would be difficult to have the garbage cans there.</p>

      <p>- New construction downtown advocates should be allowed a bicycle unit, a manager's room, etc.</p>

      <p>- The business owners in the area are not against the project; they are just against the size of the building.</p>

      <p>- The notice of the hearing was not included in the <u>Independent</u>.</p>

      <p>- People who are accustomed to read the announcements of the hearings did not get the full information.</p>

      <p>- She discovered that there is money that was set aside for double lanes.</p>

      <p>- Steps could have been made to send information to neighborhood organizations.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Continuance - Heard at the call of the item.</i></p>

      <p><b>Marilyn Amini</b></p>

      <p>- She submitted a request from the San Francisco Coalition of Neighborhoods as well as the West Portal Neighborhood Association.  They were not aware that this hearing was going to take place.</p>

      <p>- With Planning Code amendments there is a certain period of time that needs to be met for the case to be publicized.</p>

      <p>- The bike plan was not put into the public file at the Planning Department until recently.</p>

      <p><b>Lia Shaham - San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</b></p>

      <p>- She does not support a continuance.</p>

      <p>- The bike plan has been available since September of last year.</p>

      <p>- They have presented this plan to more than 100 neighborhood groups.</p>

      <p>- There were 11 neighborhood workshops and 400 people attended the meetings.  These meetings were held throughout San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- For people who could not attend the meetings there were surveys which were available online or by mail.</p>

      <p>- The information submitted was incorporated into the plan.</p>

      <p><b>Mary Miles</b></p>

      <p>- Can she speak to the continuance and to the merits of the project?</p>

      <p>- She specifically asked for notice on action of the bicycle plan and before the environmental review.  She received nothing.  She knew about this when she went to the Planning Department for something else.</p>

      <p>- This plan is very important and it will have significant impacts in every neighborhood in the city.</p>

      <p>- She supports a continuance.</p>

      <p><b>Burt Hill</b></p>

      <p>- He lives in Twin Peaks and attended the meetings held.  He knows people from the West Portal area that attended the meeting as well.</p>

      <p>- He does not support a continuance.</p>

      <p><b>Andy Thornley</b></p>

      <p>- There have been meetings held at libraries as well.</p>

      <p>- There are no funds to do extensive outreach but to the extent that they were able to, they communicated this issue.</p>

      <p>- He does not support a continuance.</p>

      <p><b>Tom Collin</b></p>

      <p>- Although he drives his car more often than his bicycle, he supports the plan.</p>

      <p>- There are some neighborhood associations [that claim of] never having been notified about this plan or this hearing yet the accusations are not really fair and/or accurate.</p>

      <p>- He is not in support of a continuance.</p>

      <p><b>Rob Anderson</b></p>

      <p>- He never heard of any bicycle coalition meeting in his neighborhood.  </p>

      <p>- There are a lot of problems with public outreach.</p>

      <p>- He does favor a continuance.</p>

      <p><b>John Daniel</b></p>

      <p>- He lives near Bernal Heights.</p>

      <p>- Any delay will cause a certain number of injuries if proper bike lanes are not instituted.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Merits of the Project</i></p>

      <p><b>(+) Oliver Gajda - Department of Parking and Traffic</b></p>

      <p>- The program is new to San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- This plan began in 1992.</p>

      <p>- There has been a lot of public comment on this program.</p>

      <p>- The plan has a two-part format: 1) policy framework and 2) network improvements.</p>

      <p>- The plan will be in conformity with other plans:  San Francisco Master Plan - Transportation Element and the MTC Regional Bicycle Plan.</p>

      <p><b>(+) John Daniel</b></p>

      <p>- He lives in the Mission Bernal Heights Neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- It is a matter of life and death to move forward on safety for bikers.</p>

      <p>- He owns a car but also tries to get around on a bike.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that more people will ride their bikes when these changes are implemented.</p>

      <p>- The car population is increasing as much as the human population.</p>

      <p>- There were people who were here earlier but could not stay and are in support of this program.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Chet Anderson</b></p>

      <p>- He lives in the Marina.</p>

      <p>- He tries most of the time to commute on a bike.</p>

      <p>- He rides around the City [on his bike] and gets his friend to also when they visit him in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- He hopes the Commission will move forward on this.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Chuck Bierwirth</b></p>

      <p>- He is in favor of the bicycle plan and should not wait any further.</p>

      <p>- The City will be a safer place to live.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Jeff Swinerton</b></p>

      <p>- He has been a bicycle rider most of his life.</p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to approve this program.</p>

      <p>- The bike plan has the right way to increase the level of safety needed for bikers.</p>

      <p>- The bike plan has provisions for many things.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Mary Miles</b></p>

      <p>- She urges the Commission to not adopt this plan today.</p>

      <p>- There are numerous reasons to not approve this plan.  For example, there was no environmental review.</p>

      <p>- Legally this plan should not be exempt from environmental review.</p>

      <p>- CEQA requires an environmental review.</p>

      <p>- There will be several impacts on this.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Rob Anderson</b></p>

      <p>- Bicycle riding is dangerous.</p>

      <p>- According to the DMV there were thousands of registered car owners.  This is a reality.</p>

      <p>- He does not own a car.  He uses public transportation and walks.</p>

      <p>- There will never be enough transportation modes for bikers in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- It is quite obnoxious for a person to come to the Planning Department and have quite a difficult time to get public information.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Tim Colin</b></p>

      <p>- The main part of the objections seems to be procedural.</p>

      <p>- There are far more car pedestrian collisions than car bike collisions.</p>

      <p>- He strongly urged the Commission to approve this plan.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Leah Shahum</b></p>

      <p>- This is a policy action.</p>

      <p>- There are no specific changes in the document.</p>

      <p>- This policy is about giving people that want to bike the ability to do it safely.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that the Commission will pass this policy.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Maureen Gaffney</b></p>

      <p>- The goal of San Francisco Bay Trails is to add trails to various locations.</p>

      <p>- ABAG was very involved in the creation of the bike plan.</p>

      <p>- She supports this plan.</p>

      <p>- She urges the Commission to adopt this plan.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Andy Thornley</b></p>

      <p>- The notion that this is a radical plan is wrong.</p>

      <p>- The Commission has the opportunity to approve a fantastic and wonderful thing.</p>

      <p>- This plan should be part of the General Plan.</p>

      <p>- San Francisco has always been looked at as a beacon for changes and improvements in human life.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Bert Hill</b></p>

      <p>- He is 56 years old and has been biking all his life.</p>

      <p>- He has been doing this safely.</p>

      <p>- There are a vast majority of the people in the hearing room who biked when they were kids and many do not do that anymore.</p>

      <p>- This will allow turning San Francisco into a safe and healthy city.</p>

      <p>- All of the aspects of this plan are for safety.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Marilyn Amini</b></p>

      <p>- Various speakers spoke about the massive public outreach yet there was still information that was not available to the public until recently.</p>

      <p>- The plan conflicts with the transit first policy.</p>

      <p>- When there are reduced lanes for cars there will be impeded traffic.</p>

      <p>- There will also be congestion with MUNI.</p>
