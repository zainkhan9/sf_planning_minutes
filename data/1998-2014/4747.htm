<p><strong>SPEAKERS: Alicia Klein, Robert Osier, Lisa Hamburgh, Joe Porcora, Buck Bugot,

<p><strong>ACTION: Approved with conditions as modified:</strong> </p>
<p><strong>A. Windows along the Mission Street and Cesar Chavez Street frontages above the
ground story shall be recessed a minimum of four inches from the facade, as reflected in
the 'Window Detail', <u>Exhibit B</u>.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>B. The occupancy and affordability of the fifty-five (55) dwelling units in the
Project shall be governed by the terms of that certain San Francisco HOME Program Loan
Agreement dated as of April 25, 1997, and Declaration of Restrictions dated as of April
18, 1997 (collectively, the &quot;Loan Documents&quot;), between the Project Sponsor (then
known as Bernal Heights Housing Corporation) and the City and County of San Francisco.
This condition of approval does not prevent the City and County of San Francisco from
amending the Loan Documents' occupancy and affordability restrictions, or subordinating
such restrictions to the lien of another lender, as may be necessary or appropriate to
ensure (in the judgment of the Mayor's Office of Housing) the feasibility of the Project
as affordable housing to low income households. In the event the Loan Documents are
terminated for any reason, other than foreclosure by a senior lender or a deed in lieu of
foreclosure to a senior lender, then the affordability requirements contained in those
documents shall continue to apply, pursuant to this Motion, for the entire original term
of the Project Sponsor's obligations under the Loan Documents. </strong></p>
<p><strong>C. The Project Sponsor (Housing Services Affiliate) shall appoint a <em>community
liaison officer</em> who shall be primary contact person to address any neighborhood
complaints regarding the operation of the development. The Community Liaison Officer will
work cooperatively with interested neighborhood groups and the City to respond to
complaints, such as (a) off-street parking problems on Precita Avenue and (b) excess
traffic on Precita Avenue.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>D. During the initial tenant orientation meetings, and during occupancy of new
tenants, the Project Sponsor will give written information to all tenants (and users of
the child development center and community resource center) regarding the following: (a)
the need to use Cesar Chavez and Mission Streets (and not Precita Avenue) for picking up
residents and other users of the development by automobile, (b) the need for all residents
(except those in the three units closest to Precita Avenue) to enter the complex through
the Mission/Cesar Chavez Street entrance and not to use the Precita Avenue entrance gate
and c) the need for all users of the development who are by automobile heading either
south on Mission Street or west on Cesar Chavez Street <em>not to use</em> Precita Avenue
for access to the development, but rather to use the following Planning Department
preferred route: making a left on onto Valencia Street from Cesar Chavez Street, then a
left from Valencia Street onto Mission Street, and then a right on Cesar Chavez Street to
the vehicular entrance to the development's garage.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>E. The Project Sponsor will keep the Precita Avenue gate locked from the
outside and will give keys to enter that gate only to the residents of the several units
closest to Precita Avenue and to agents of the Project Sponsor. </strong></p>
