She believes that this is a violation of the law, which has been in affect for a very long time.  Commissioners are different from elected officials.  Commissioners cannot solicit campaign contributions from anyone who has been before them in the preceding three months.  If someone does make a contribution, there is a conflict for a year after the contribution.<br>- She was aware of this event from reading the newspaper and read the reports online from the Ethics Commission.<br>- This event was held on September 23, 2002 and Andrew Junius attended this event and made a campaign contribution the previous week of $500.00.<br>- Mr. Junius wrote a letter stating that the contribution was rescinded.<br>- She believes that this does not apply in this instance since she believes that Mr. Junius did intend to attend this function.<br>- If any other Commissioners attended this event and solicited funds, they also have conflicts under the law.<br>- This is a very serious matter and she would like to have a response from Commissioner Theoharis or her attorney and not from Mr. Junius.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RESPONSE:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner Theoharis<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has not violated the law and will not recuse herself.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Re:  Merits of the case<br>(-) Sue Hestor &ndash; Representing three of the DR Requestors (Ms. Lynn Hall, Ms. Miller, Mr. Hogan)<br>- Although the project has been revised, one of the issues from her clients is what is the nature of the landscaping?<br>- The lot is heavily wooded with lots of vegetation.  These trees are going to come down.<br>- Her clients will see walls from the rear of their house. <br>- She displayed graphics of current vegetation.<br>- The Commission has not been presented with the revisions.<br>- The scale of the house is very massive.<br>- There is nothing in the staff analysis related to the problems when there is a very large development down a grand driveway that has cars coming in the middle of the lot.<br>- The lot is located behind her clients' houses.  There is a massive amount of space for a driveway.  The driveway is just over scaled.<br>- The house could be setback 8 feet and would reduce the impact on her client's houses.<br>- The project sponsor has not addressed the concerns of his neighbors.<br>- There are issues about soil stability as well as major engineering issues.<br>- The Commission should require scaling the building back as well as putting serious restrictions on this project like prohibiting the driveway to be used as a roadway for events with large parties and large amounts of cars parked on other people's back wall.<br>(-) Susan Patton Murray &ndash; DR Requestor<br>- She is here on behalf of her mother.<br>- They are concerned about the size of the project.<br>- They are concerned about maintaining the integrity of the hillside and the ramifications of the costs associated with the engineering required to deal with this complex site.<br>- She read a letter from a civil engineer expressing concerns about the hillside.<br>(-) Frank M. Van Kurk &ndash; DR Requestor<br>- They have had serious slope problems.<br>- His mother was forced to have an engineered footing designed to prevent the down slope moving of the home.<br>- He is concerned that any excavation below the property will cause problems to several of the homes.<br>- Mr. Akabato's employees have entered his mother's property to remove vegetation and this has not been brought up.<br>(-) Arnie Lerner<br>- The perspective views are very misleading.<br>- The projects will be on the faces of the DR requestors.<br>- The plans kind of disguise how large this project will really be.<br>(+) Andrew Junius &ndash; Project Sponsor representative<br>- There are a lot of neighbors who are in support of the project although they have similar impacts.<br>- The scale issue is an important one here but the size of the lot is quite large.<br>- The topography hides most of the project from several of the neighbors.<br>(+) Mr. Stephen Antanaros &ndash; Project Architect<br>- Displayed diagrams of the project.<br>- Described the architectural aspects of the project.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took discretionary review and approved the project as revised by project architect:  The revision proposed is to reposition 168 Yerba Buena Avenue.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Lim, Fay, Salinas<br>NAYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoharis, Joe, Chinchilla<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001.527D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R.
