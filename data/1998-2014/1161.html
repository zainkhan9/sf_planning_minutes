    </ul></ul><p>4.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- It was reported to them that money is being released for staff to begin the EIR.</p>

        <p>- She  would like to receive periodic updates on the status of the EIR effort and receive a work plan and a timetable.</p>

        <p>- The Commission needs to be informed.</p>

        <p>- When the policies were adopted in February, the maps were not that legible.  It would be helpful to her to have a large format map of the zoning so that she knows what parcels and what blocks are being referenced.  The large format would be at least 11 x 17 and in color.</p>

        <p>- She would like to see a list of projects that are pending since the policies were adopted.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Status of Budget</i></p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Acting Director will speak on this.</p>

        <p>- Also, she would like to see the status of the search for the new Planning Director since we allocated moneys in the budget for this purpose.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- He that staff do exit interviews with PDR firms that have left San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- He has a list if staff needs the information.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>5. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Budget</i></p>

        <p>- The budget was released officially by the Mayor.</p>

        <p>- It is a mixed budget for the Planning Department.  It calls for new money to finish environmental reviews that have been lagging.</p>

        <p>- It calls for $300,000 for computer operations/equipment.</p>

        <p>- It adds five positions to the Planning Department (two new Environmental, two Citywide Planners, and one graphic artist).</p>

        <p>- It gives money to hire consultants to do another Better Neighborhoods Program.</p>

        <p>- The Mayor requested a 20% cut in support/administrative staff in order to put money into direct services positions opposed to administrative support.  As a result, seven positions have been lost.</p>

        <p>- It was one of the hardest things he has had to do as Acting Planning Director.</p>

        <p>- Money will be contributed to the support of the City Attorney.</p>

        <p>- It calls for about a 14% increase in revenues.</p>

        <p>- Regarding the money that was allocated for the Director's search, this was eliminated from the budget.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

        <p>- She realizes that Planning is being more appreciated yet there is a lack of understanding that the department needs to be lead.</p>

        <p>- She is concerned that there are various projects pending right now for Planning; the Commission is short one member; etc.</p>

        <p>- She does not think that support will come from the Mayor's office.</p>

        <p>- She is very interested in the Commission participating in the process of hiring a new director as per the Charter.</p>

        <p>- She does not know how a search process will begin and not have any funds for it.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- It is extremely difficult for the department to face layoffs.</p>

        <p>- The choices are to do what is needed to save a few jobs or save the City.  This is a tough job.</p>

        <p>- The situation is actually positive even after the layoffs.</p>

        <p>- The Director comes back July 1 and at that time, we will schedule a closed meeting to talk to him.  Hopefully, this will happen with what is happening at the Mayor's office.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>- There is a search underway via the Mayor's office for a Director, but are the funds coming from there rather than from the Planning Department?</p>

        <p>- He does not believe that $50,000 is needed for this procedure.</p>

        <p>- The openness of the process is more important than the money.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- On May 13, the Commission talked about putting a committee of three together to address this.  Is this something that she can initiate?  This might answer Commissioner Antonini's question.</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Deputy City Attorney, Susan Cleveland-Knowles responded:</font></p>

          <p>- The issue of putting the committee together can be scheduled.</p>

        </ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

        <p>- It is very important to find a leader for the Planning Department.</p>

        <p>- The final choice will be made by the Mayor's office after the Commission chooses candidates.</p>

        <p>- The Commission needs to be very cooperative and very firm.</p>

        <p>- Everyone wants to see the needs of the public related to land use get solved</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Acting Director Badiner reported on another matter</font></p>

        <p>- He met with the senior managers of Citywide and is requesting information on finding a procedure to process the plans.  What would the timelines be?  What would be the deliverables, etc.?</p>

        <p>- When this information comes in there will be frequent updates to the work plan.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donaghue - Residential Builders</font></p>

        <p><i>Re: Processing Permits</i></p>

        <p>- He gets enraged that no one is speaking about processing permits.</p>

        <p>- It takes about 6 to 10 weeks before a project is assigned to a planner.</p>

        <p>- The Mayor and the Board of Supervisors did not give the current Director his due process.</p>

        <p>- There will be a lawsuit filed to block any transfer of funds from the Board of Building Inspection.</p>

        <p>- There will be two two-bedroom units and one one-bedroom unit that will be below market rate.</p>

        <p>- There is a need for family housing so the average size of the units will be very good elements for family housing.</p>

        <p>- They have eliminated a driveway so there will only be one curb cut.</p>

        <p>- There will be a pedestrian based element in order to enhance pedestrian use/environment on the street.</p>

        <p>- The adjacent property has a skylight and windows and the proposed project will have setbacks to respect them.</p>

This was recommended language from the Landmarks Board.

      <ul><ul><p>The proposal is to:</p>

        <ul><p>2) Rehabilitate the historic building fa&ccedil;ades;</p>

        <p>3) Construct a one-story vertical penthouse addition that would be set back from both the Market Street and Mason Street facades, and create a light well along the eastern property line;</p>

        <p>4) Convert the existing office use to approximately 33 dwelling units;</p>

        <p>5) The Project will not provide parking as required by the Planning Code, nor will thirteen of the units meet the technical Planning Code requirements for dwelling unit exposure, and only three of the 33 units will have private open space.  No common space will be provided on the project site, which is completely occupied by existing building.  Given these factors, variances would need to be granted for parking, dwelling unit exposure, and residential open space requirements.</p>

        <p>6) The proposed project would provide its required Below Market Rate (BMR) units on site as well as the off-site BMR units required for a proposed companion project located at 690 Market Street (2003.0584MTZXCKLU).</p>

          <ul><p>7) The project sponsors are seeking to avail themselves of the Mills Act, which allows local governments to grant property tax relief benefits in exchange for the guaranteed preservation of a historic property.  In order to qualify under the San Francisco Administrative Code, the property must either be designated as a San Francisco Landmark or listed separately on the National Register.  As neither condition is the case with the subject property, the project sponsor is seeking conditional San Francisco landmark status.  The proposed Landmark Designation would become final upon the completion of the proposed project consistent with the Rehabilitation Program set forth by the proposed Mills Act contract.</p>

        <p>- The proposal will renovate a building constructed in 1875 including an enlargement of two dwelling units.</p>

        <p>- The project raises the building four feet to create a below grade garage.</p>

        <p>- The building will be reduced the same amount raised so that is does not become taller.</p>

        <p>- The density on the block face ranges from 1 to 27 units.</p>

        <p>- The structure will maintain the architectural significance of the building.</p>

        <p>- The building now has studios and one bedroom units.  These will be converted to family units.</p>

        <p>- The project satisfies all requirements from the Planning Code and Master Plan.</p>

        <p>- The project will preserve and rehabilitate a building built in 1875 as well as provide family units.</p>

        <p>- This project is historically significant.  This modification would destroy it by expanding to the rear.</p>

        <p>- Raising the top parapet will add to the bulk appearance.</p>

        <p>- This is a high density building with parking that is close to transit.</p>

    <p>- The project restores and saves a much altered old cottage in the Telegraph Historic District.  The project renovates the cottage and has constructed a new cottage.</p>

    <p>- By maintaining the scale of the two buildings, preserving the existing cottage and surrounding the space with landscaping, allows for an unusual significant investment.</p>

    <p>- The Planning staff have approved all the details of the project except for one:  the treatment of the old cottage's existing front door and access from the Union Street steps.</p>

    <p>- The Landmark's Advisory Board approved all the requirements except for the door.</p>

    <p>- The Telegraph Hill Homeowner's Association would like to save the door and move it to the level below since the entrance is now from a courtyard.  If the door was moved it would create two front doors which would not be agreeable to the owners.</p>
