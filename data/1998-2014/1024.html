      <p>7. Commission Comments/Questions</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>
      <p>- She would like to invite the public to Mayor Brown's 
        seminar for Women's History Month. It will be held on Wednesday, March 
        12, 2003 at 5:00 p.m. and Doris Ward will be honored.</p>
      <p>- In observance of Passover, she canceled the Commission 
        hearing scheduled for April 17, 2003.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>
      <p><i>Stonestown Project</i></p>
      <p>- He would like to update the public on the issue 
        of his residence being within 500 feet of the Stonestown project. According 
        to the City Attorney's office, the actual measurement is determined from 
        the beginning of the property, not from the beginning of the project. 
        Based on this determination, his property is 397 feet from the Stonestown 
        property and he can not participate as a commissioner on this matter.</p>
      <p>- He Recused himself from participating as a commissioner 
        during the hearings, but stated that the City Attorney's office had informed 
        him that he could participate as a resident of the area. Therefore, during 
        much of the hearing on this project he will be part of the public/audience.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>
      <p>- She would like to have the City Attorney provide 
        the Commissioners with some guidance on the standards for determinations 
        of unsound buildings.</p>
      <p>- It is unclear to her what the standards are.</p>
      <p><i>Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator commented that 
        there would be a hearing on this issue as well as other Discretionary 
        Review issues on March 20, 2003.</i></p>

      <p><i>Re: Housing Element</i></p>
      <p>- The Commission received this document in their packets. 
        The final draft was released on February 10, 2003. There will be a hearing 
        on this issue on March 27, 2003.</p>
      <p><i>Re: Commissioner Hughes concerns related to 40-50 
        Lansing Street</i></p>
      <p>- He has verified that the clerk's office <u>hours 
        are from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.</u> <s>does close at 5:00 p.m.</s></p>
      <p>- Any documents received after 5:00 p.m. should officially 
        be stamped as received at 8:00 a.m. the next morning. This was an error 
        on behalf of the Office of the Clerk. </p>
      <p>- The Clerk's office will schedule this appeal before 
        the Board of Supervisors, but as of today it has not been calendared.</p>
      <p>- This Conditional Use has been calendared before 
        the Commission but this date will be impacted by the date it is calendared 
        for hearing by the Board of Supervisors.</p>

      <p><i>Re: 1338 Filbert Street - Landmark of Cottages</i></p>
      <p>- This issue was continued from the meeting of Monday, 
        February 24, 2003.</p>
      <p>- There was a question dealing with noticing of the 
        hearing to the owner of the property. The item will be considered again 
        this coming Monday, March 3, 2003.</p>
      <p><i>Re: 1250 Haight Street</i></p>
      <p>- On the agenda of March 3, 2003, there will be a 
        discussion on legislation that essentially amends the Planning Code and 
        Zoning maps to create the Haight Street Senior Affordable Housing Special 
        Use District thus enabling the Conditional Use application to move forward 
        on the 40-unit, affordable senior housing project by Citizen Housing Corporation.</p>
      <p><i>Re: Conditional Use Revocation Ordinance by Supervisor 
        Gonzalez</i></p>
      <p>- On January 16, 2003, the Commission considered Supervisor 
        Gonzalez's ordinance amending the Planning Code to allow for the revocation 
        of a Conditional Use authorization upon finding that the applicant provided 
        false information in obtaining the Conditional Use.</p>
      <p>- The Land Use Committee will consider the ordinance 
        this Monday.</p>
      <p>- Staff forwarded the Commission's positive recommendation 
        on the legislation along with suggested amendments for language to clarify 
        what would constitute &quot;false information&quot; that could justify 
        revocation of a Conditional Use approval.</p>
      <p><i>Re: 1193 Oak Street</i></p>
      <p>- This matter will be heard by the full board on Tuesday, 
        March 4, 2003.</p>
      <p>- This is an appeal of a January 9, 2003 authorization 
        by the Commission of a Conditional Use to establish a bed and breakfast 
        inn within the second floor dwelling unit. Staff will be there to represent 
        the Commission.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">BOA</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: 138 28<sup>th</sup> Street </i></p>
      <p>- This case was heard by the Commission on May 30, 
        2003 and was disapproved.</p>
      <p>- The project consisted of merging four units to two 
        units and to construct a 4<sup>th</sup> floor</p>
      <p>- The Commission disapproved the merger but approved 
        the 4<sup>th</sup> story.</p>
      <p>- The Board of Appeals upheld the Commission's decision.</p>

      <p>- She spoke on behalf of the project sponsor for this 
        massage establishment.</p>
      <p>- The establishment will not be detrimental to the 
        health, safety, convenience or general well fare of the persons residing 
        or working in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>- This massage is a therapeutic service for people 
        who feel pain.</p>
      <p>- There is no control from having homeless people 
        stop in the doorway.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Natasha Stone</font></p>
      <p>- She has been a patient of acupressure shiatsu and

      <p>- The project sponsor has been able to help a lot 
        of people.</p>
      <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this 
        establishment.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Linna Lai Wang</font></p>
      <p>- She is a nurse and is on her feet a lot.</p>
      <p>- She hurt her knee and after receiving treatment 
        from acupressure she feels a whole lot better.</p>
      <p>- She enjoys receiving treatment from this spa.</p>
      <p>- There is no need for patients to remove their clothes.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) John F. Long - Complete Business Services</font></p>
      <p>- He has been to this massage establishment and there 
        is more than adequate room to treat the patients.</p>
      <p>- There is more than adequate service as well.</p>
      <p>- He hopes that the homeowners association is not 
        using this as a smokescreen to evict the owner.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Cindy Chen</font></p>
      <p>- She spoke on behalf of the owner of the massage 
        establishment.</p>
      <p>- She displayed a photograph of the new signage of 
        the massage establishment, which states clearly that Shiatsu Acupressure 
        is provided.</p>
      <p>- This will be an asset to the community.</p>
      <p>- She displayed photographs of the interior of the

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Terry Chen</font></p>

      <p>- There have been many changes in the City.</p>
      <p>- The area is changing to diversified nationalities.</p>
      <p>- There should be no problem for a small business

      <p><i>Re: 226 17<sup>th</sup> Avenue</i></p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mary Iracki</font></p>
      <p>- She has lived on 17<sup>th</sup> Avenue since 1959.</p>
      <p>- She is concerned that there will be a precedent 
        if this project gets approved.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Juanita Waycott</font></p>
      <p>- She owns a single-family dwelling on 17<sup>th</sup> 
        Avenue.</p>
      <p>- She is opposed to the demolition because every time 
        a single-family dwelling is demolished a very large apartment building 
        gets built.</p>
      <p>- This causes an impact on the parking and traffic 
        on the street.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Norma Lee Cook</font></p>
      <p>- There have been a lot of single-family homes demolished.</p>
      <p>- It's like loosing the composition of the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>- She would like to have the Commission not demolish 
        this building.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Organization</font></p>
      <p>- He is here trying to prevent this demolition.</p>
      <p>- Each demolition results in units being more expensive 
        after they are rebuilt.</p>
      <p>- This building is sound and there is no question 
        about it.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jack Norton - SORE</font></p>
      <p>- He opposes the demolition of sound housing and the 
        destruction of the Richmond neighborhood--replacing housing with huge 
        monsters.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bill Iracki</font></p>
      <p>- He opposes the demolition of sound housing.</p>
      <p>- He discussed the cost estimates with the planner 
        and the planner removed almost everything.</p>
      <p>- The foundation was repaired under permit in 1956.</p>
      <p>- The cost to repair is not 50% of the cost of rebuilding.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Megan Sullivan</font></p>
      <p>- She is opposed to the demolition and construction 
        of the new building.</p>
      <p>- She feels that the new building is too large and 
        it will stand out like a &quot;sore thumb.&quot;</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Terry Rolleri</font></p>
      <p>- He is interested in homes that do not have garages.</p>
      <p>- About 30% of the people that live in this City do 
        not have cars.</p>
      <p>- He is in opposition to the demolition of this home.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Peter A. Cully - Structural Engineer</font></p>
      <p>- He was hired by Mr. Iracki to look at the data for 
        the demolition of this property.</p>
      <p>- He has personally looked at the foundation and it 
        is quite sound.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Steve Williams</font></p>
      <p>- There is nothing wrong with this house.</p>
      <p>- The problem with the developers is that the entire 
        demolition and building report are (designed) just to construct a new 
        building.</p>
      <p>- This house could be sold and be habitable.</p>
      <p>- The project sponsor should seek an alteration permit 
        not a demolition permit.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Owen Brady - Save Our Richmond Environment</font></p>
      <p>- This organization opposes the demolition of this 
        structure. He does not believe that there is a need to lift the house 
        to remove the asbestos.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Mark Stender</font></p>
      <p>- He would support the demolition of this house if 
        for no other reason than that it would support property owner's rights.</p>
      <p>- There is an energy crisis and these older homes 
        are looked at as a little quainter than they actually are.</p>
      <p>- A house of this nature is not particularly attractive.</p>
      <p>- He does not see any problem with removing this building.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Phillip Whitehead</font></p>
      <p>- This home requires that it be demolished and it 
        needs to &quot;be put to rest.&quot; There is dampness and mildew that 
        causes health problems.</p>
      <p>- A new building would be an improvement.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bruce Bauman</font></p>
      <p>- This proposal is 100% code compliant.</p>
      <p>- The house is not historic and it is not affordable. 
        The new dwelling would provide affordable housing.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Lau</font></p>
      <p>- He is the project designer and engineer.</p>
      <p>- The porch of the property is unsound as well as 
        the rest of the house.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Reuben - Representing the Project Sponsor</font></p>
      <p>- This project is completely code compliant.</p>
      <p>- He received at the last minute the document from 
        the Discretionary Review Requestor regarding the cost of repair vs. demolition.</p>
      <p>- According to the report from the Project Sponsor, 
        the cost to repair this building exceeds 50% of the cost to repair.</p>

      <p><u>STONESTOWN VILLAGE PROJECT - 3251 20<sup>TH</sup> AVENUE</u> - <font class="heading2">Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:</font>  The project site is located on the south side of Eucalyptus Drive, immediately west and northwest of the Stonestown Galleria shopping center. The proposal includes a mixed-use development comprising approximately 366,800 gross square feet (gsf) on approximately 13.7 acres primarily used as surface parking for the shopping center.  The proposed development includes both residential and neighborhood-serving retail components.  The residential component includes three five-story, 50-foot-tall apartment buildings, approximately 96,250 gsf, 71,400 gsf, and 62,350 gsf, respectively, with 202 subsurface parking spaces; and a two- to three-story, approximately 30-foot-tall senior care facility, totaling approximately 70,300 gsf, with 17 parking spaces.  The proposed retail component includes development of a 27-foot-tall, 41,600-gsf grocery market, and construction of neighborhood-serving retail spaces totaling approximately 24,900 gsf.  The project would include construction of two parking garages and reconfiguration of two surface parking lots that would contain about 1,684 total commercial parking spaces to replace 1,500 existing commercial spaces displaced by the proposed project construction, and provide 184 net new parking spaces to serve the proposed retail uses. The proposed project would also incorporate landscaping features, such as streetscape connections, landscaped walkways, interior courtyards, and open space. To implement this project, the proposed project would require a Conditional Use authorization (CU) to amend the existing Planned Unit Development (PUD) to modify allowable residential density for the apartment community and potentially modify rear yard setback requirements for both residential components. In addition, an amendment of the Zoning Map would be needed to change the height district from 40 feet to 50 feet. The 13.7-acre project site is located in the Lakeshore neighborhood within Assessor's Block 7295 and includes portions of Lots 21, 22, and 23. The site is primarily within a C-2 (Commercial Business) zoning district, and portions are within a 40-X and 65-D height and bulk districts.</p>

          <p>(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 13, 2003)</p>

      </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Supervisor Tony Hall</font></p>

      <p>- He has submitted a letter to the Department detailing all his concerns about the completeness and accuracy of the draft EIR and hopes the Commission will each take the time to read it.</p>

      <p>- He will touch on a few of the highlights of his comments, which are a result of his analysis of the DEIR as well as a compilation of many of the concerns he has heard raised by the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- Initially, the DEIR was only going to include an impact study in 3 of the 14 possible areas.  After a public scoping hearing which he sponsored last February, the scope of the Report was expanded to include 7 of the 14 possible areas.</p>

      <p>- He thinks the DEIR should include a full discussion of why the other seven areas are not included in the DEIR.</p>

      <p>- The most incomplete statement, and what he thinks is the biggest failing of the DEIR, is on page 60 where the DEIR says that the project will not disrupt or divide the physical arrangement of an established community, and that the project will not have a substantial impact upon the existing character of the neighborhood.  </p>

      <p>- The DEIR only defines community and character with technical planning jargon.  The real neighborhood community and the real character of the neighborhood are standing behind him at this hearing - whether or not they are opposed to the project or in support of the project.  The neighborhood is not defined by planning jargon but by the people and institutions in the area.  They are not adequately and completely defined in the DEIR.</p>

      <p>- To be complete, the DEIR should better define what the neighborhood's community and character are.</p>

      <p>- He thinks the DEIR, in order to be complete, needs to provide more discussion about how the increased traffic will affect pedestrian safety in the area.  The DEIR only mentions that there are three schools in the area.  It fails to include Lakeside Presbyterian Pre-School, Mercy High School, and San Francisco State, which are all within walking distance of the project.  The DEIR says there will be no impacts on pedestrian safety.  However, I think the DEIR should use a higher standard of care in evaluating whether or not there is an impact because there are so many children in the area.</p>

      <p>- There are a number of traffic estimates in Tables 3,4, and 5 on pages 90 and 91 that appear contrary to common sense. These tables estimate that the new grocery store will only generate 149 more trips on a Saturday than on a Tuesday.  It seems to him that the vast majority of people do their grocery shopping on weekends, and the weekend number estimate should be much higher.</p>

      <p>- The Table 7 on page 97 states that there will be a 0 short term parking demand for the 202 units.  Does this mean that the residents of the units will never have any visitors?  Table 7 also estimates that the short term demand for parking at the Senior Care facility will be the same on weekdays as it will be on weekends.</p>

      <p>- There appears to be a conflict between Table 5 and Table 7.  Table 5 says 2,483 daily vehicle trips will go to the market.  But then Table 7 says there will only be a need for 128 parking spaces.  How do 2,483 cars fit into 128 spaces.  Granted, the 2,500 cars will be dispersed throughout the day, but that seems to be pushing the envelope by expecting no more than 128 to be there at any one time.  If each car did one hours worth of shopping and was evenly spread out throughout the day - which is really a faulty assumption, the store would have to be open 20 hours a day to fit all 2,500 cares in the 128 spaces.</p>

      <p>- Without getting into further detail, he would like to alert the Commission to the other points he has raised in his letter: </p>

      <p>1. The DEIR should include a complete discussion of why there are no geology/topography effects resulting from the project.</p>

      <p>2. The DEIR should identify the eleven so-called &quot;soft sites&quot; in the area where other development may occur.</p>

      <p>3. The DEIR should explain why the nearby Stonestown Apartments are lower in density and height.</p>

      <p>4. There are four schools along Eucalyptus - not three schools as listed in the DEIR.</p>

      <p>5. The cumulative impact of the traffic of the four schools should be looked at as a whole, not in groups.</p>

      <p>6. There is no discussion of future expansion and growth of these nearby schools and that impact in the area.</p>

      <p>7. There should generally be more discussion about the impact of the project on the schools, rather than the other way around, which is how I read the DEIR.</p>

      <p>8. The pedestrian patterns of Mercy High School's students should be evaluated.</p>

      <p>9. St. Stephen's peak passenger loading area is not between 8:30 and 9:00 as stated in the DEIR - school starts at 8:00 a.m.</p>

      <p>10. The morning p.m. peak period on Ocean Avenue between 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue and Middlefield should be discussed.</p>

      <p>11. What are the pedestrian volumes along Eucalyptus, and will there be an impact?</p>

      <p>12. On what Sunday were the 113 church related parked cars observed in Lot D - on a three day weekend or a Holy Day of Obligation or on an average Sunday?</p>

      <p>13. What kind of squeeze of parking will result in the Merced Manor neighborhood from the YMCA and church goers who currently park in the Stonestown property?</p>

      <p>14. Is 263 vehicles for 202 units a realistic estimate of the vehicle demand in the proposed building?</p>

      <p>15. Will people visiting the Senior facility and/or proposed units be more likely to park in Merced Manor than the Stonestown property to avoid internal Stonestown traffic?</p>

      <p>16. What route will construction vehicles and future loading vehicles take to reach the site?  Will they be going through the neighborhood?</p>

      <p>17. Finally, I think there needs to be further explanation of the fact that the proposed grocery store is the real cause of the resulting traffic increase as opposed to the proposed housing.</p>

      <p>- He thinks his office has been very fair, patient, and deliberative in reviewing this project over the last 2 years.  Balancing both property rights and the varied wishes and desires of the neighborhood, he has consistently respected the process, and it is his sincere hope that the Commission and the Planning Department will follow his lead in respecting due process by responding to all of the questions and concerns raised tonight.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Kate White - Director of the San Francisco Housing Action Coalition</font></p>

      <p>- Stonestown village will provide a mall with much needed housing as well as neighborhood-serving retail.</p>

      <p>- She would like to grow old in this town and the senior units are the kind of support housing that is desperately needed especially right near services and transit.  Seniors own less cars and will not have such a traffic impact.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor has &quot;bent over backwards&quot; to accommodate the neighborhood's concerns.</p>

      <p>- This DEIR takes a very careful look at the impacts.  This project replaces a surface parking lot with a very-much needed transit oriented development.  It is perfect for this area because it is right near MUNI.  The community needs a grocery store.</p>

      <p>- She urged the Commission to support this project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rick Quire - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- He requested a continuance of this case because of the newsletter that gave erroneous information.</p>

      <p>- People have been misinformed about this project.  Who knows how many people have read the newsletter and the draft DEIR.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bill Chionsini - West of Twin Peaks Central Council</font></p>

      <p>- He is here on behalf of this organization and other citizens.</p>

      <p>- He agrees with the previous speaker regarding continuing this project.</p>

      <p>- He submitted a letter that asks to discuss certain sections of the draft DEIR.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Adena Rosmarin - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- This project will have significant negative impacts on areas that have not been included in the draft DEIR.</p>

      <p>- They have submitted factual evidence and expert opinions regarding these impacts.</p>

      <p>- This document is very incomplete.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jim Herlihy - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- There are critical areas of study that have been left out of this draft EIR.</p>

      <p>- Noise is not covered in this document.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ron Chun - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- The neighbors are all here to respectfully request that this commercial developer answers all the questions (required) by law that should be discussed in a draft environmental impact report.</p>

      <p>- This neighborhood approved the creation of the Stonestown mall that (that exists today), and made it the success that it is.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Len Stefanelli - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- He feels that this draft EIR is incomplete.</p>

      <p>- There is a possible landfill site in back of the Stonestown mall.</p>

      <p>- There was a revene that has been filled in with something over a period of time.</p>

      <p>- There has not been any testing on the soils on this site.</p>

      <p>- He recommends that this document be reevaluated and submitted for review.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gregory Bayol - President of the Sunset School Board</font></p>

      <p>- Nowhere in the draft EIR does it discuss the issue of noise during construction and how it will affect the schools in the area.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Stephens Johns - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- He also spoke on the negative affects of noise during construction.</p>

      <p>- There is no noise report in this document.  This makes it completely inadequate.</p>

      <p>- This document is supposed to provide something that the neighborhood could look at and not have to figure things out.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard Levino - St. Stephens Church</font></p>

      <p>- The direct negative impacts of this project on the schools in the area are not addressed.</p>

      <p>- The document also does not give correct information on traffic impacts.</p>

      <p>- He has read other impact reports and they are very detailed where this one is not.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Dawdy - Merced Manor</font></p>

      <p>- He lives one block away from the project site.</p>

      <p>- Hydrology is not considered in the impact report.</p>

      <p>- The good points and the bad points should be covered in the draft EIR, but they are not.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Maureen Bender - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- There is a park located in the area and she is concerned with open space.</p>

      <p>- This project would come as close as 9 feet from the park.  This would cause damage to the trees in this park.  She is also concerned with the birds and animals of that park.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned with the church and how it will be impacted.</p>

      <p>- She is also concerned about noise.</p>

      <p>- She and her neighbors are concerned about neighborhood character.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Doris Dawdy - Merced Manor</font></p>

      <p>- She is a freelance writer and researcher and has done a lot of research on this project and this document.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned that the document does not provide all the facts.</p>

      <p>- There has been unfair advertisement of this project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Karen Niglio - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- There is nothing wrong with promoting the project, but she has a problem with promoting the EIR.</p>

      <p>- She asked the Commission to extend the comment period.</p>

      <p>- She does not understand how many of the facts of the draft EIR were computed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Cristophe Niglio - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></p>

      <p>- He has extensively reviewed the draft EIR.</p>

      <p>- Although he will be submitting his written comments on the draft EIR, there is one critical and damaging error regarding traffic impacts that should be addressed.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to request an accurate transportation study.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Michael Garcia - Board member of Merced Manor</font></p>

      <p>- He is concerned with the traffic impact this project will cause.</p>

      <p>- He would like the Commission to insist that this document be accurate and objective.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Stephen Wilson - St. Stephens School and St. Stephens Church</font></p>

      <p>- As a parish and a school, they are concerned with the safety of the children.</p>

      <p>- His three summary points:  1) this development has become a moving target because it is incomplete and inconsistent; 2) there is a problem with (not) presenting a cumulative impact; and 3) the project alternatives are weak.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Susan Calapietro</font></p>

      <p>- She is happy to see the Stonestown project become a reality because she does not drive-she takes public transportation.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Tim Colen - President of the Edgehill Way </font></p>

      <p>- He is a geologist and has helped prepare many EIRs.</p>

      <p>- The geology has been adequately addressed in this document.</p>

      <p>- A lot of the other issues have been address quite adequately.</p>

      <p>- This project brings senior assisted housing, 200 units of rental housing, and better retail services.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-/+) Dick Morten</font></p>

      <p>- He has supported the construction of housing in his neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- He is disappointed in the process because he could not understand where the rental units will be.</p>

      <p>- He would recommend that a better break-out be established by type of use.</p>

      <p>- He also agrees with a lot of the concerns from the previous speakers.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Catherine Russo</font></p>

      <p>- She lives in Stonestown.</p>

      <p>- The traffic from the market is spread out during the day.</p>

      <p>- Housing is desperately needed in the City.</p>

      <p>- This is a big under used piece of land.</p>

      <p>- Housing for seniors is greatly needed.  Some seniors need to go to other counties because they can't receive housing or services here.</p>

      <p>- It is a fact that there will always be noise when there is construction.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Frank</font></p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to adopt the draft EIR.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bette Landis</font></p>

      <p>- The kids going to the schools in the area are going to need places to live.</p>

      <p>- There will be an increase in revenue from property taxes and commercial exchanges.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-/+) Robert Bender - Park Merced Resident Association</font></p>

      <p>- The Commission should get more information from this draft EIR.</p>

      <p>- There have been some things that have been glossed over.</p>

      <p>- This housing should be built.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ted Theotis</font></p>

      <p>- He has listened to the traffic situation.  However, his personal concern is that crossing Junipero Serra and Winston Drive is the most frightening thing in his life.  He does not wish to die at the present time.  He hopes the Commission will keep their eyes open on the traffic situation.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Robert Blandis</font></p>

      <p>- Housing is severely needed.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to support.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Chin Chow</font></p>

      <p>- She has many concerns regarding this project and the draft EIR.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bud Wilson</font></p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Therese McGovern</font></p>

      <p>- She urges that this draft EIR not be accepted.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) William Wortsen</font></p>

      <p>- He noticed that something was overlooked or omitted regarding transportation in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Willow J. Solomoni, Jr.</font></p>
