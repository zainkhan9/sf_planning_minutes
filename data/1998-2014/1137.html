The Project Sponsor worked with Supervisors McGoldrick and Peskin and developed some significant amendments.  This was brought back for consideration to the Board of Supervisors.<br>- The Board overturned the Commission's decision by a vote of +9 -2, then amendments were added and the Board approved the project.<br>- These amendments involve the number of units and other items that the Project Sponsor is to provide to adjoining property owners.

Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1, bounded to the north and east by John F. Kennedy Drive, to the south by Tea Garden Drive and to the west by the Hagiwara Japanese Tea Garden.  The proposed project would demolish and reconstruct the M.H. DeYoung Museum on the site of the existing DeYoung Museum in Golden Gate Park.  The project would include demolition of eight existing buildings, totaling approximately 230,000 square feet, which compose the DeYoung Museum and the Asian Art Museum.  (The Asian Art Museum will move to the Civic Center.)  The new building would include two main levels above grade, one level below grade with a varying roof height ranging from 33 to 48 feet, and a 144&#64979;foot tower at the northeast corner of the project site.  The building would increase current DeYoung Museum gallery and exhibition space at the site from the existing 37,000 sf to total about 75,000 sf.  The project would remove the 85 existing paved parking spaces for museum staff, currently on the eastern side of the museum, and would not provide replacement parking.

The revisions to the original project and associated environmental effects are set out in the Summary of Comments and Responses &ndash; Section B. The 37,860 sq.ft. site contains an existing surface parking lot with landscaping which is used by the adjacent Wells Fargo Data Center.  The revised project would contain about 600 hotel rooms along with ancillary support uses such as meeting rooms, restaurants, and retail space (the originally proposed 60 to 70 residential condominiums have been eliminated).

Planning Code Section 134(a)(1) requires a rear yard of 25 percent of the lot depth to be provided at the lowest story containing a dwelling unit and at each succeeding story.
