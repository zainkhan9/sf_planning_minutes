              <p><u>329 BAY</u><b> </b>- south side between Powell and Mason Streets through to Vandewater Street; Lot 036 Block 0041 - <b>Request for Variance </b>from rear yard requirements, pursuant to a project that would demolish the existing, largely vacant, one-story building with 8,550 square feet of existing retail space to construct a new four-story building approximately 40 feet high, containing 21 dwelling units and 3,100 square feet of retail space.  Twenty-one parking spaces would be located below grade, with vehicular access from Vandewater Street. Section 134(a)(1) requires that a building which contains dwellings in this district have a minimum rear yard depth equal to the larger of 25 percent of the lot depth or 15 feet.  The subject lot is 120 feet deep and the required rear yard would be 30 feet. The project proposes no rear yard, but substitutes two light courts approximately 25 feet in depth on each side property line at mid-lot. The site is zoned C-2 (Community Business District), in the Northern Waterfront Special Use District #2, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.</p>

              <ul><p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>

              <p><i>Re:  Zoning an Entertainment District</i></p>

              <p>- Has San Francisco ever considered an entertainment zoning district?</p>

              <p>- He would like staff to investigate where entertainment in the City can be located.</p>

              <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

              <p><i>Re: Notice Processing</i></p>

              <p>- There has been a lot of discussion about problems in the processing of notices.</p>

              <p>- He believes that part of the conflict  with the delays has been seen between the public's ability to comment freely and be heard in full, and the ability to move projects forward.  The public should be able to comment for as long as necessary. </p>

              <p>- He believes that noticing should be increased as much as possible to achieve the broadest outreach to the public within their neighborhoods.  This should include commercial projects.</p>

              <p><b>Commissioner S. Lee:</b></p>

              <p><i>Re:  Status of Various Projects</i></p>

              <p>- As the Commission begins to review neighborhood plans and adopt the plans, questions from the public comes up regarding the status of these jobs.</p>

              <p>- She asked the City Attorney for a written opinion on the legal entitlements of the projects the Commission approves.</p>

              <p>8. Discussion of the responsibilities assigned to the Zoning Administrator by City Charter and Planning Code.</p>

              <p><i>Judy Boyagian, Deputy City Attorney, commented:</i></p>

              <p>The Zoning Administrator is a Charter Official. This position is specifically mentioned in section 4.105 of the Charter.  The only power that he has that is expressed in the Charter itself is the authority to determine Variances. Prior to the Charter amendment in 1996, there were other Zoning Administrator powers in the Charter (for example:  enforcement of the code) but they were removed in the 1996 revision.  Everything except for the Variance power is in the Planning Code.  Most of the duties are set out in Section 307. </p>

              <p>Many people are aware that the Zoning Administrator will also issue written interpretations of the Planning Code.  These are now on the Planning Department's web site. He has the power to enforce the code through calling on other city officials like the City Attorney, District Attorney and Chief of Police.</p>

              <p>The Zoning Administrator's primary duty is to interpret and enforce the Planning Code.  One of the issues that has been contentious recently is when the Planning Commission has approved a project and imposed conditions on it, what is the authority of the Zoning Administrator to modify those decisions when the Commission's decision id appealed to the Board of Appeals or Board of Supervisors and they impose conditions?  Basically he has no power to modify or change the decision.  What he does have the authority to do is to interpret that decision.  Section 174, specifically states that conditions that are prescribed on projects by the Planning Commission, Board of Appeals or Board of Supervisors actually become provisions of the Planning Code.  The specific provisions of the Planning Code can be enforced and interpreted by the Zoning Administrator, in the same way as enacted provisions of the Planning Code. </p>

              <p>If there is a question about whether a project modification is consistent with the decision approval action, the Zoning Administrator is the only actual official that has the authority to make the decision, interpret the action.  The clearer the action is of course, the easier his job is.  If it is a little ambiguous, he has a harder job.  Any decision he makes in that regard is appealable to the Board of Appeals. </p>

              <p><b>Bernard Choden</b></p>

              <p>- Things have gotten worse in the past eight years.</p>

              <p>- The remedy is to realize the needs of the City.</p>

              <p>- Reform is needed to modernize the Planning process.</p>

              <p>- The Zoning Administrator position has a lot of power.</p>

              <p>- It is important that the Zoning Administrator find out what the problems are but not try to solve them himself.</p>

              <p><b>John Schlesinger</b></p>

              <p>- He commended the Commission for their comments on this matter.  You (the Commission) are concentrating on the position and not on the individual.</p>

              <p>- There is a necessity that the position be an autonomous position.</p>

              <p>- The public may not agree with the decision, and may fight the decision, but the important thing is that the Zoning Administrator does what is stated in the Planning Code.</p>

              <p>- This is a very important issue for neighborhood groups.</p>

              <p><b>Gerry Crowley - Former President of the Telegraph Hill Dwellers' Association.</b></p>

              <p>- She is concerned about a particular case where she believes that the Zoning Administer actually changed the law with a determination. </p>

              <p>- The case is a restaurant known as Basta Pasta at 1234 to 1268 Grant Avenue.  The space operated as a pasta restaurant from 1986 to 2000.  Under plans that were approved under interim controls, the plans were approved one week prior to the North Beach Commercial District legislation being passed.  There were extensive negotiations between the neighborhood organization and the project sponsor.  Just to the exterior, for example, there were violations of the original CU.  In 2000, the restaurant closed and four years later in 2004 the building was sold. The new buyers asked the Zoning Administrator for the abandonment provisions of the code. The Zoning Administrator found that the abandonment did not apply because the original owner had tried to sell the property as a restaurant and didn't intend to abandon it.  Now that four years have gone by, the Zoning Administrator says that the code, that the law does not apply. </p>

              <p>- She beleives that the Zonining Administrator has a very dangerous use of power. </p>

              <p><b>Kepa Askenasy</b></p>

              <p>- This is one of the most important things that the Commission will be discussing.</p>

              <p>- He knows that the current Zoning Administrators is one of the most ethical people that he knows.</p>

              <p>- The Board of Appeals is another autonomous body.</p>

              <p>- Over the last ten years there have been a lot of changes in various neighborhoods.</p>

              <p>- There are decisions that the Zoning Administrator has made that are kind of &quot;fuzzy.&quot;</p>

              <p>- The Zoning Administrator has created policy for certain areas when in fact that was not the intention of the Commission.</p>

              <p>- When the interpretations are added up, they can become actual policy.</p>

              <p>- He was Zoning Administrator for 25 years.</p>

              <p>- This subject is a very difficult one.</p>

              <p>- Previously, the Planning Code was less complex than it is now so there were fewer things to interpret.</p>

              <p>- There are a lot of &quot;grey&quot; areas in the Planning Code.</p>

              <p>- Uses over time have been changed and added to the code.</p>

              <p><b>Eileen Gold</b></p>

              <p>- She has been here before in September of 2004 regarding a project on 18<sup>th</sup> Street.</p>

              <p>- The ZA referenced a motion by the Board of Supervisors.  This project has been going on since the 90s.  In 2001, the Commission made certain conditions about the project that was appealed to the Board of Supervisors.  They added more conditions to the project.</p>

              <p>- Instead of the correct motion, the ZA used the previous motion before the Board of Supervisor's conditions.</p>

              <p>- They have gone through the Board of Appeals but have had no luck.</p>

              <p><b>Charles Marsteller</b></p>

              <p>- The Zoning Administrator, as with the Commission, can be removed only if there is a just cause.</p>

              <p>- As a civil servant, the Zoning Administrator is subject to an annual review.</p>

              <p>- There should be some clarification of the structure of his position.</p>

              <p>- The Commission has raised very interesting questions today.</p>

              <p><b>John Bardis</b></p>

              <p>- Neither the Commission nor the Zoning Administrator has the ability to change the law.</p>

              <p>- The ZA does interpretations according to the law.</p>

              <p>- There should be questions when the Commission has issued an action and it is not carried out.</p>

              <p>- He appeared before the Land Use Committee.  They understand the Planning Department's issues which are the reasons for our delays.</p>

              <p>- There will be a fee analysis to make them consistent; the tracking system will be integrated; and finally, an analysis of procedures and processes will be done.</p>

              <p>- Also, our short-term solution will be to fill the vacancies.</p>

              <p><b>Alicia John-Baptiste reported</b></p>

              <p>- The Department has a number of vacant positions which totals about 16% of the total funded positions.</p>

              <p>- There is a hiring program in place for each of the five major areas in the Department. </p>

              <p>- Three positions in the environmental analysis unit, seven in neighborhood planning, seven in city-wide, three in the Director's office and two in administration. </p>

              <p>- There have been two offers to date, both of which have been accepted.  Over the next couple of weeks, there will be a number of interviews for Planner II and Planner III positions.</p>

              <p>- At the same time, there is recruitment going on for a number of other positions, those include the higher level planner positions--the Planner IV positions, as well as some classifications that fall outside of the planning series, including a community outreach coordinator. </p>

              <p>- Interviews for these positions will probably start in early to mid May with staff coming on board a month after that process begins. </p>

              <p>- Search for all these position includes internal and external applicants as well as promotions.</p>

              <p>- With all the new staff, there is hope that soon the backfill will become less and less.</p>

              <p><i>624 Divisadero </i></p>

              <p>- This was an appeal of an 18-unit condominium at a location where a church would be demolished.  There was very little discussion at the Planning Commission.</p>

              <p>- A neighborhood group indicated that this had been a theatre and felt that it was important to preserve.  An environmental analysis of the project was done but did not result in the original negative declaration being withdrawn.</p>

              <p>- Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi lead a negotiation that resulted in the project being revised so that rather than the theater being demolished which fronts on Divisadero, the building fronting on Hayes would be built.  The back of the theatre would be demolished but the public spaces of the theatre would be retained.</p>

              <p>- The appellant was not satisfied with this and still had concerns.</p>

              <p>- The project was continued.  Perhaps a new CU will be issued and brought back to the Commission.</p>

              <p><i>Re:  One Polk Street</i></p>

              <p>- There were changes to the design of this project.</p>

              <p>- This 1930s art deco apartment building had steel windows that were deteriorating.</p>

              <p>- The project sponsor wanted to replace the windows with vinyl windows.  Staff has argued that it is important to maintain the same type of window systems.  Staff has not been very successful on this.  </p>

              <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

              <p><b>(+) Lisa Zayas Chien - Planner at the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency</b></p>

              <p>- The agency has been contemplating this area since 1994.</p>

              <p>- They have been working with a citizen's advisory committee.</p>

              <p>- The project area was selected in 1997.</p>

              <p>- The project area committee consists of various neighborhood residents that have an interest in what is happening there.</p>

              <p>- The agency has gone through a lot to listen and gather the resident's comments and issues.</p>

              <p>- This is a very interesting project that brings together various issues.</p>

              <p><b>(+) Anthony Faber - SOMA Leadership</b></p>

              <p>- This initiation should be approved to get the &quot;ball rolling&quot; in order to see what the Commission likes and doesn't like.</p>

              <p><b>(+/-) Susan Bryant</b></p>

              <p>- She has met with several groups and they feel that it is a bit early for initialization.</p>

              <p>- The community still has concerns like:  housing, more Inclusionary housing, transportation, arts, etc.</p>

              <p>- There is a lot more community outreach that should be done.</p>

              <p><b>(+/-) Jakkee Bryson</b></p>

              <p>- Her question is: &quot;What is the rush?&quot;</p>

              <p>- Can the arts money be used to expand the building?</p>

              <p><b>(+) Sam Duke</b></p>

              <p>- She pleaded with the Commission to start this now.</p>

              <p>- This has been worked on for so long and no one is rushing.</p>

              <p>- The PAC meets every week and the main body meets once a month.  This project should start.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Robert Ingalls</b></p>

              <p>- He has been living in San Francisco all his life.</p>

              <p>- He wants to continue living here even if he has to live in substandard conditions.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Bill Murphy</b></p>

              <p>- He is a third generation San Franciscan living in SOMA.</p>

              <p>- SOMA and the Tenderloin are the most negatively affected by this Mid-Market Plan.</p>

              <p>- 35% of Inclusionary housing should be rental housing.</p>

              <p>- Local businesses and jobs will be lost.</p>

              <p>- Community, cultural and arts should be encouraged in the area.</p>

              <p>- Mid-Market will be turned into a Manhattan with this proposal.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Bruce Allison</b></p>

              <p>- He is opposed to this proposal.  He is disabled and is currently living in SOMA.</p>

              <p>- Most of the rooms in these buildings are vacant because people cannot afford it.</p>

              <p>- It all started with Moscone when he displaced a lot of people.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Richard Marquez</b></p>

              <p>- This proposal is making SOMA into a Manhattan.</p>

              <p>- Who lives there?  People who deserve community based services, affordability, etc.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Casey Mills - Center City SRO Collaborative</b></p>

              <p>- There has been a lack of community involvement with this proposal.</p>

              <p>- The people that will be most affected were not involved in this proposal.</p>

              <p>- Now they are forced to approve a plan that is totally against them.</p>

              <p>- This plan will increase subsidized gentrification.</p>

              <p><b>(-) April Veneracion - South of Market Community Action Network</b></p>

              <p>- More can be done at Mid-Market in regards to jobs and community based services.</p>

              <p>- She urges the Commission not to initiate this plan until further discussions have been done.</p>

              <p><b>(+) Byron Yee - Member of the Mid-Market PAC</b></p>

              <p>- They have done extensive outreach in the area and everyone has to be heard.</p>

              <p>- This plan has nine to ten years in the works.  No one is rushing.</p>

              <p>- The community is representative of the PAC and vice-versa.</p>

              <p><b>(+) C.J. Higley - Reuben and Junius</b></p>

              <p>- They do think that the time has come to initiate this plan.</p>

              <p>- After ten years, the time has come.</p>

              <p><b>(-) David Wilbur</b></p>

              <p>- He is a recent PAC member.</p>

              <p>- He is one of two people that voted against this plan.</p>

              <p>- This was not a very open process.  Most of the meetings were held at the Flood building in back rooms.</p>

              <p>- Most of the powerful land use attorneys have developed this plan.</p>

              <p>- It is important that there is review of all the community impacts.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Carolyn Blair - SF Tree Council and the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</b></p>

              <p>- The coalition is concerned.  This will generate increased automobile traffic and be hazardous for bicycle riders.</p>

              <p>- Market Street is the busiest bicycle corridor.</p>

              <p>- There are existing heavily used bicycle lanes on 7<sup>th</sup> and 9<sup>th</sup> streets.</p>

              <p>- The Transportation Authority Market Street study calls for decreasing car traffic and increasing pedestrian and bicycle riders' safety.</p>

              <p>- They oppose residential parking in areas that are rich in public transportation.</p>

              <p>- Cars can live underground but not people.</p>

              <p>- This plan should be amended.</p>

              <p><b>(-) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City</b></p>

              <p>- There are outstanding concerns with this plan.</p>

              <p>- The mid-market area has one of the lowest ownership of cars in the City.</p>

              <p>- Despite having low ownership of cars, the area has high transit of cars.</p>

              <p>- There are high statistics of people getting killed by cars.</p>

              <p>- They oppose one to one parking, allowing three stories of aboveground parking, etc.</p>

              <p>- This plan is not ready for &quot;prime time.&quot;</p>

<ul>
  <p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of 
    interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of 
    the Commission except agenda items. With respect to agenda items, your opportunity 
    to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the 
    meeting with one exception. When the agenda item has already been reviewed 
    in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify 
    and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address 
    the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the 
    Calendar. Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three 
    minutes. </p>
  <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item 
    not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public 
    comment. In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>
  <p>(1) responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; 
    or</p>
  <p>(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; 
    or </p>
  <p>(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda. (Government Code 
    Section 54954.2(a))</p>
