She feels that because of the article she has no choice but to answer Supervisor McGoldrick's concerns.  At the time she made the announcement, she was concerned about her health.  What has changed? Her health problems have gotten better.  Also, she is no longer president so there is much less stress in her life.  Another reason she decided to stay at the Commission is because when she made the announcement, there were so many phone calls and letters that were concerned about her leaving the Commission.  Articles like this can hurt many people.<br><br>Commissioner Chinchilla:  He is glad that Commissioner Theoharis has decided to stay on the Commission.  He agrees with Commissioner Theoharis that articles like this hurt many people and are quite irresponsible.<br><br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br><br>Re:  Community Workshops<br>- On February 12, 2002, the second of a long series of community workshops was held at the ODC Theatre.  The Department as well as the community met regarding Mission District Interim Controls and the future zoning of the district.<br>- On February 13, there was a unique public session on the scoping of the Stonestown EIR.  Supervisor Hall assisted in putting together a meeting place and time.  The community met to discuss their desires to ensure that certain aspects were included in the environmental review process.  This is actually the first of its kind.<br>- On February 20, 2002, there will be another workshop in the South of Market area.  The Arc of Refuge was the location for the meeting but there is some problem with handicap access so the alternate location is the Recreation Center and as soon as information is final, the Department will announce it.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS<br>Re:  Transportation and Commerce Committee<br>This morning, the Planning Director met before the Transportation and Commerce Committee to discuss the progress of the Planning Department.

Public hearing will remain open on any new recommendations for approval.<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) Bill Poland<br>- He will not be in town next week.<br>- The Leno Legislation does not work for the rental projects his company intends to build.<br>- He hopes that the Commission will reduce to 12%.  The 14% does not work, in his opinion.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to February 21, 2002<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas, Theoharis<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000.749T               &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                      (LORD: 558-6311)<br>Consideration of adoption recommendations for an Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code to add Section 315 to 315.9 to establish requirements for all residential developments of 10 units or more to provide inclusionary affordable housing units.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation: Pending<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued from Regular Meeting of February 7, 2002)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) Joe O'Donaghue &ndash; Residential Builders<br>- He considers this legislation to hide the wrinkles <br>- This proposal is flawed.<br>- With all due respect to the Department, this analysis needs to be done on a dollar per dollar, cost for cost proforma because banks are not going to take the risk.<br>(-) Sean Keighran&ndash; Residential Builders<br>- He is a small developer.<br>- Small developers are not allowed the luxury of hiring contractors to build their projects for them.  They are forced to build their projects with their own hands.  <br>- The lenders will not allow them to draw wages for their efforts.
