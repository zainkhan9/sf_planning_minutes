The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002.0474D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(S.

The subject property is located in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the demolition application.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proposed for Continuance to August 1, 2002)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued as Proposed<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas, Theoharis<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore<br><br><br>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of Adoption - draft minutes of May 9, 2002<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas, Theoharis<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission Matters<br>Commissioner Theoharis:  There was an article in the Chronicle regarding the demolition cases being heard today.  The article inferred that the Commission was crowding these types of cases because their (commissioner's) terms might be up by the end of June.  She would like to clarify that the Commission instituted a policy that these cases would have to come before the Commission, even though they didn't have to legally, but because they deserved additional scrutiny.  Because the Commission became aware that there was a backlog of these cases, they scheduled a special hearing on a 5th Thursday (fifth Thursdays are usually canceled) to handle them.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOS &ndash; None<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOA<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:  1117 Judah Street<br>The Commission took Discretionary Review on September 5, 2002 and requested that the project sponsor cut back the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors by 8 feet.  The Board approved what the project sponsor had proposed to them:  cut back half of the building adjacent to the DR requestor but allowed the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th floor to go back approximately 8 feet. The Board felt that there were special configurations from the DR requestor but that should not grant them a right or an easement over the adjacent property.<br><br>Re:  337-339 Mississippi Street<br>The Commission took Discretionary Review on December 6, 2001 and denied the dwelling merger.  The Board overruled the Commission's decision stating that the market has changed and there are a lot of vacancies and rentals.  This merger would create family housing, which is desperately needed.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(L. BADINER: 415-558-6350)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of Adoption of Commission policy on Annual Office Limitation Program &ndash; Project Construction<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued from Regular Meeting of May 23, 2002)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) Jul Niemier<br>- He is opposed to this policy.  He would like the Commission to not renew or extend this policy.<br>(-) Mary Bobbitt<br>- She is opposed to the Bryant Square Project.<br><br><br><br>(-) Tom Wetzel &ndash; Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition<br>- He is against this policy because during the hearing of the Bryant Square project, the argument of adverse economic impacts could not be used to the benefit of the developers.<br>- It is shameful to allow this reasoning to go ahead because it shows that the Commission is out for the interest of the developers and not the people of the City.<br>(-) Sue Hestor<br>- There has not been enough notice of this item.<br>- Last week there was a different description on the agenda than this week's agenda.<br>- This is a major policy that needs to be discussed.<br>- This item should be continued<br>(-) Luis Granados &ndash; Mission Economic Development Association<br>- He asks that the Commission not take action on staff's recommendation since the recommendation will be a huge policy decision.<br>- He believes that projects got permits on a different set of standards.  This policy should apply to projects from here forward and not retroactively.<br>(-/+) Tay Via &ndash; Cobletz, Patch, Duffy and Bass &ndash; Representing the Project Sponsor of First and Howard Streets<br>- If the Commission adopts the new policy in terms of reporting and performance, she requests that they be treated as the other projects.  If not, they will come back for an extension.<br>(-/+) Tim Tosta &ndash; Steefel, Lefitt and Weiss<br>- His only concern is the message that might be sent from this policy.<br>- He strongly supports staff recommendation but has a suggestion that would add a further recommendation:  add a provision that would declare that under the economic circumstances like the one we are going through today, that the time be eclipsed from the calculation.<br>(+) Jim Reuben &ndash; Reuben & Alter<br>- He supports the six to eight projects on the list that his firm has been working on.  He is also in support of the staff recommendation and resolution as drafted.<br>(-) Calvin Welch &ndash; Council of Community Housing Organizations<br>- He has not seen the recent amendment to the recommendations from the department.<br>- The thrust of this amendment is to act exactly as in 1991, the question he has is what about the changes in the conditions of the laws of the City?<br>- If changes of conditions are to be discussed, then the full order of changes and conditions need to be discussed.<br>- The department needs to let the development community understand that when they come before the Commission a year or two from now, they will be required to meet the new levels of mitigations.  This statement is not made clear.<br>(-) Robert Herr- 350 Bush Street Project and the Bryant Square Project<br>- The policy as revised by the Director of Planning and the Zoning Administrator is a sound policy and should be endorsed by the Commission.  The language can always be improved.<br>(-) Oscar Grande &ndash; People Organizing to demand Environmental and Economic Rights (PODER)<br>- He hopes that the Commission will take no action and continue this matter to another date in order to bring more people from the community to state their comments.<br>(-) Doug Perry &ndash; Editor of Organized Labor<br>- He is worried about the economy of San Francisco since he is dependent on office building development.<br>- Given the current state of the economy, it is important not to discourage development because it brings jobs and revenue into the City.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved with final language modifications.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Lim, Salinas, Theoharis<br>NAYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe<br>MOTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16418<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. GHOSH:  415-558-6275)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CITY PARKING POLICY<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Discussion of City's Parking Policy as defined in the Charter, General Plan and Planning Code.<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(+/-) Sue Hestor <br>- There are a couple of issues related to parking:  1) where there is a reduced parking requirement, it gives a benefit to the developer yet nothing goes to MUNI; 2) there should be increased affordability requested on development projects.<br>(+/-) Peter Albert &ndash; Manager of Planning for San Francisco and Bay Area Rapid Transit system<br>- Transit oriented development makes sense for the Bay Area and San Francisco.<br>- It takes housing, which is very much needed, and links it to transit.<br>- People need a choice as well, and that is not being provided right now.<br>- General Plan policies make sense for San Francisco in the right location but parking is at the core of the issues.<br>(+/-) David Snyder &ndash; San Francisco Bicycle Coalition and Transportation for a Livable City<br>- CTLC is a new organization dedicated to connecting land use and transportation and improving transportation for everybody.<br>- The code needs to be changed to encourage more housing and more affordable housing and change the parking requirements as necessary.  This will be just housing for the rich, and poor people will be thrown out of the City in larger numbers than they are now.<br>- Alternatives are key.  MUNI is getting a lot better.  The pedestrian advocates are getting stronger.  The new NTA is working on a new bicycle plan.  Now is the time to look at this.<br>(+) Tom Redoulavich &ndash; Member of the BART Board of Directors and a Founding Member of San Francisco Housing Action Coalition<br>- Staff is headed in the right direction.<br>- He is happy to encourage the department to do anything that increases ridership on BART.<br>- The transit system is on the mend in the City.<br>- The whole transportation picture needs to be looked at.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meeting Held.
