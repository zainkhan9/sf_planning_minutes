The property is currently used as a paved parking lot by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Annex and other government agencies for 270 vehicles.  The rezoning project includes rezoning part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 and Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High-Density) with a 300- and 400-foot height limit.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial subdistrict under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the <i>Rincon Hill Area Plan</i>, a part of the <i>San Francisco General Plan</i>.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with development proposed at 300 Spear Street on Assessor's Block 3745, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district.  The development portion of the project would consist of up to 725 residential units (about 825,000 gsf) and about 38,000 gsf of retail space.  It would include about 753 enclosed parking spaces and four loading spaces for the use of the development, and about 272 enclosed replacement parking spaces for the use of the USPS and other government agencies.  An 80-foot-tall building base would cover the site.  Two residential towers would rise above the building base to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level.  The project would require a subdivision of Lot 1 to separate the development site from the Postal Service Annex.  <font class="heading2">Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.

      <p>- The Commission will have a joint hearing with the Park and Recreation Commission on June 26, 2003, at 12:30 p.m.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee</font></p>

      <p>- Stated her desire to establish a procedural protocol for the timely review of major projects (such as large environmental documents).  Have previous Commissions requested anything similar to this?</p>

      <p><i>Commission Secretary responded:</i></p>

      <p>- Commissions in the past have established timeframes for the review of large documents or major projects.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

      <p>- Last week there was a project in which the project sponsor believed they were offering to participate in the First Source Hiring Program and then learned that they were required to do so.  The legislation states that &quot;all Commissions shall cooperate in connection with their respective duties relative to the issuance of permits subject to this and that the Planning Department shall have total jurisdiction for the conditions imposed on the permit.&quot;  She would like to have this added to the standard conditions for project where it applies.</p>

      <p><i>Zoning Administrator responded:</i></p>

      <p>- It is a usual practice of the department [to include this].  He will make sure that this is standardized.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

      <p>- He seems to believe that there is a problem expediting projects.  He would like staff to find ways to expedite things; move the process faster.  How can the Commission help on this?</p>

      <p>- He appreciates receiving documents on time but he understands that it will never be possible to be 100% prepared.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Budget</i></p>

      <p>- He wanted to know the status of the budget.</p>

      <p><i>Director Green Responded:</i></p>

      <p>- The Mayor's budget was presented to the Planning Department last week.  Included in that budget was an enhancement on the department's budget which allowed funding of 7 vacancies that currently exist.</p>

      <p>- He went before the Budget Committee and presented the work program, what the budget allows the department to carry out, and what the department would not be able to carry out.</p>

      <p>- He will appear this coming Thursday to respond for the first time to the Budget Analyst's report and will report back to the Commission.</p>

      <p>- The Board of Supervisors has found a way to come forward with additional revenue to televise Planning Commission hearings.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Housing Element Hearing on Monday, July 21, 2003 at the Board Chambers</i></p>

      <p>- There was a hearing on this item on June 5, 2003.  After testimony, the Commission decided to establish a special hearing to receive more feedback on this issue.</p>

      <p>- Since then, the Clerk of the Board's office informed the Planning Department that they will have special hearings that week so we will no longer be able to have the Housing Element hearing in the Board's chambers.</p>

      <p>- The second option is to hold a hearing on July 31, 2003 on the Housing Element.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

      <p>- There continues to be an effort to work out a solution to this issue.  It was continued until this coming Tuesday, June 24.  The appeal was filed by the group &quot;Restore Hetch Hetchy&quot; and supported by the Sierra Club.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Secondary Units Environmental Exemption Appeal</i></p>

      <p>As a courtesy to Supervisor Jake McGoldrick, who is out of the country and requested a continuance of this item, Supervisor Aaron Peskin, the sponsor of the legislation, agreed to continue the appeal until the July 15 meeting of the Board of Supervisors.  The Commission will therefore need to continue the consideration of the legislation that is currently on the calendar for next week until after July 15.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  1017 Ocean Avenue</i></p>

      <p>- The Board considered the appeal of this Conditional Use authorization to install three Verizon wireless antennas on this 3-story, multi-use structure.  The Board disagreed with the Commission's determination that the antennas are necessary and overturned the CU authorization by an +8-2 vote, with Hall and Dufty dissenting.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Board of Supervisors Meeting of June 24, 2003:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  40-50 Lansing Street</i></p>

      <p>- This is a Conditional Use appeal of an 82-unit residential project.  The appeal was filed by five members of the Board of Supervisors (Daly, Ammiano, Gonzales, Sandoval and Maxwell).  The appeal of the Negative Declaration decision has already been appealed and upheld unanimously by the Board of Supervisors.  Now the CU appeal hearing has been set for the June 24 meeting of the Board.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  3725 Buchanan Street</i></p>

      <p>- This is a Conditional Use appeal of eight Verizon wireless antennas.  The appeal was filed by 20% of surrounding property owners.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Budget Committee</font></p>

      <p>- The Budget Committee placed $80,000 into the FY2003/04 budget of the Department of Telecommunications and Information Services for the broadcasting of Planning Commission hearings on SFGTV.  They also placed $50,000 into the same budget for the Board of Permit Appeals.</p>

The property is within an SLI (Service/Light Industrial) Mixed-Use Zoning District, the Fourth and Freelon Streets SUD (Special Use District) as recently established by Board of Supervisors Ordinance Number 27-03, the Mixed-Use Housing Zone as set forth in Planning Commission Resolution 16202, the proposed SES (South-End Service) District as set forth in Planning Commission Resolution Numbers 14843 and 14844, and a 50/85-X Height and Bulk District.</p>

      </ul><p><font class="heading2">(-) Calvin Welch - San Francisco Information Clearing House</font></p>

      <p>- Six months ago, the developer of this project came forward to this Commission and mentioned that the principal reason for asking for this development, that would exceed heights and bulk limits, was a tremendous benefit because affordable housing would be provided somewhere at sometime.</p>

      <p>- He disagrees with the Director's characterization of what the law says.</p>

      <p>- The developer is still in the same situation they were in six months ago.</p>

      <p>- The developer has not submitted a mechanism that would assure the construction of the affordable housing which is a necessary precondition of granting the 80 foot height limit, and that is the language that this Commission put in.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Mary Lou Beemer </font></p>
