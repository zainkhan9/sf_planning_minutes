        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(Proposed for Continuance to June 17, 2004)</font></p>

The Variance application will be considered by the Zoning Administrator concurrently at the same hearing with Conditional Use authorization. The proposal is to add one four-story dwelling unit to an existing one-story commercial building on a small, approximately 700 square foot, 29.5-foot deep lot.  The commercial unit on the ground floor would remain.  No parking would be provided.  A Conditional Use authorization is required in the Chinatown Community Business Zoning District for any building exceeding 35 feet in height.  The building would be 50 feet in height with the proposed addition.  The addition, like the existing commercial building would cover the entire small site.  Therefore, both a parking and a rear yard variance would be required.  Required open space would be provided on a rooftop terrace.</p>

        <p>- On May 27, 2004, there will be a fee package that blends into the Mayor's proposed budget.</p>

        <p>- Last year the fee package ran into some legal issues before the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p>- Acting Director Badiner stated that there was no Board of Supervisors Meeting when there was.</p>

        <p>- At that hearing there were about 70 pieces of property that were transferred.</p>

        <p>- All of these properties have a specific area where neighbors should be notified.</p>

        <p>- She came to the Planning Department to ask for information on the NEMIZ and waited for about an hour but was later told that she was not able to receive a copy.</p>

        <p>- When the item of the Housing Element is scheduled it should be timely because information has not been made available to the public and the hearing is next week.</p>

        <p>- This was heard by the Land Use Committee and passed out.</p>

        <p>- For areas outside of the downtown, this legislation would require a Conditional Use for spaces of more than 50,000 square feet.  It would prohibit any use in excess of 120,000 square feet.</p>

        <p>- In the downtown area, it would require a Conditional Use for any use larger than 90,000 square feet and prohibit any use of more than 120,000 square feet that sells groceries and other uses.</p>

        <p>- It would also allow people to move and re-tenant when there is a large store and another similar store is moving in.</p>

        <p>- It adds criteria for the Conditional Use for this specific usage.  It would require that the Commission consider if there is an active street frontage, a change in traffic patters, mixed use business opportunities, etc.   This will be forwarded to the full Board of Supervisors and heard on May 11, 2004.</p>

        <p>- This is the first project that he has had that staff has not agreed with the soundness report.</p>

        <p>- This fails to meet the requirements of demolition because of the soundness report.</p>

        <p>- Preliminary plans were designed.  Then it was found out that the soundness report did not meet the current soundness guidelines.</p>

        <p>- There are some inadequacies with the project:  The lower unit is only 448 square feet; only a one car garage; there is a need to walk through a unit to get to another unit; etc.  The kitchen and dining area is only 140 square feet.</p>

        <p>- The building was built in 1922 as a single family unit.  The unit at the rear was added in 1954, perhaps for a relative or a son.</p>

        <p>- The current owners use it as a sound studio.</p>

        <p>- The bedroom/living room is a good size.  It was possibly intended as an in-law unit.</p>

The proposed conversion would not alter the configuration of the existing building.   Because the existing building already encroaches into the required rear yard, it is considered a legal, non-complying structure, and the conversion of the two upper floors from commercial use to residential use triggers these variances.

Public hearing on and consideration of amendments regarding the boundaries of the SOMA area excluded from the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR and Eastern Neighborhoods policies, adopted under Planning Commission Motion 16726.   The proposal is to exclude  areas west of 4th Street and east of Division Street, except the South of Market Earthquake Recovery Redevelopment Project Area from the EIR and Policies.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Jim Meko - SOMA Leadership Council</font></p>

        <p>- The Planning Department's community planning process in SOMA was a failure.</p>

        <p>- The SOMA community decided to move forward and do better.</p>

        <p>- There was a compromise to draw a line down the middle of Fourth Street and it was decided to let SOMA east of that move ahead, while west of Fourth Street, with the exception of the SOMA PAC, would be removed until there could be some real comprehensive planning done.</p>

        <p>- His highest priority is to keep Folsom Street as far east as Fourth Street in the planning process.</p>

        <p>- Folsom is going to be the heart of the new South of Market and they will want to have a say in this.</p>

        <p>- No one asked for Core PDR anywhere in SOMA.</p>

        <p>- He wants a coherent community and not just the leftovers to work with.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Bob Meyers - Yerba Buena Lofts Homeowners Association</font></p>

        <p>- The residents of the south side of Folsom Street and the north side of Clara request that there the two blocks between Fourth and Fifth Street remain in the housing mixed use boundaries that were approved last February and stay included in the EIR.</p>

        <p>- He asked that the Commission approve the compromise provided by the community.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Jeffrey Liebovitz - Rincon</font></p>

        <p>- He thanked Jim Meko for pulling together various community meetings.</p>

        <p>- Everyone has worked hard for many years to reach a compromise that will benefit everyone.</p>

        <p>- He displayed a map showing Fourth Street requesting to be inclusive of both sides of Fourth Street.</p>

        <p>- It makes sense to include both sides of Fourth Street going north.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Ed Townsend</font></p>

        <p>- He seconds the comments of Bob Meyers.</p>

        <p>- He would like to keep the boundaries proposed by the community.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">David Wilbur - SOMA PAC</font></p>

        <p>- He is the most permissive of all the speakers.  He supports the decision from staff.</p>

        <p>- To eliminate the blocks from Clementina to the bridge makes absolutely no sense.  These blocks should be included in the EIR.</p>

        <p>- There are some small blocks on the south side of Harrison Street.   If these blocks are not looked at through this process, they will never be looked at again.</p>

        <p>- There is some pressure being [exerted] by some very powerful Supervisors on members of Planning saying that if staff does not do what they want, they will be messing around with funding.  It is important for staff members to stand up and do the right thing.</p>

        <p>ACTION Approved as Amended:  The parcels between Clara and Harrison and 4th and 5th Streets and the parcels between Harrison Street and Interstate 80 and 4th and 7th Streets are now excluded from the Eastern Neighborhoods environmental review process and the Eastern Neighborhood Policies.  </p>
