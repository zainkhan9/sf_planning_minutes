<br>SAN FRANCISCO<br>PLANNING COMMISSION<br>Meeting Minutes<br><br>Commission Chambers - Room 400<br>City Hall, 1 Dr. Carlton B. Goodlett Place<br>Tuesday, December 17, 2002<br>12:30 PM<br>Special Meeting<br><br>COMMISSIONERS PRESENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shelley Bradford Bell, Michael J. Antonini; Rev. Edgar E. Boyd,<br>Lisa Feldstein;  Kevin  Hughes; Sue Lee;  William L. Lee<br>COMMISSIONERS ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br><br>THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO ORDER BY PRESIDENT BRADFORD BELL AT 12:50 p.m.<br><br>STAFF IN ATTENDANCE:  Gerald Green &ndash; Director; Larry Badiner - Zoning Administrator; Amit Ghosh; David Alumbaugh; John Billovits; Marshall Foster; Ann Marie Rodgers; Ben Fu; Michael Smith; Nora Priego &ndash; Transcription Secretary; Linda Avery - Commission Secretary<br><br>A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE<br><br>The Commission will consider a request for continuance to a later date.  The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.<br><br>None<br><br>B .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMISSION MATTERS<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission questions/comments<br><br>Commissioner William Lee:<br>1) There was an item at the Board of Supervisor's hearing yesterday related to the past audit of the Planning Department and a proposal to set up an audit committee.  He would like the director to address this issue.  Do we really need an audit committee?<br><br>2) He would like to have a presentation by the Transportation Authority regarding transportation and funding requests for the next few years. There will be changes in the transportation industry as a result of Prop B.<br>He is requesting this presentation because many of the projects the Commission will be voting on will be impacted by this proposition.<br><br>Commissioner Antonini:<br>Re:  653 Duncan Street<br>-  He has a patient who is one of the Discretionary Review requestors.  He has checked with the City Attorney's office regarding this issue and they said that there are two tests to determine conflict:  1) if the fiduciary interest exceeds $500.00 in the last month, which it has not; 2) Does he feel objective about this case and the answer is yes.  He feels he can participate.  He wanted to bring this to the attention of the public with the understanding that he has done the research related to ethics.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>Re:  Commissioner Lee's question<br>1) Supervisor McGoldrick introduced legislation that would create a task force for the Planning Department audit.  He thought it would be effective to create this task force.  <br>The Director responded to this legislation at the Transportation and Audits Committee hearing saying he would be willing to work with the Supervisor on this.<br>After yesterday's hearing before the Board of Supervisors, a task force is more than likely.  The Director will reserve his comments until he sees the information on this task force.  He will provide a copy of the audit and his response to the Commission.<br><br>Re:  Joint Hearing<br>There are proposed dates of January 23, 2003 or February 6, 2003 to have joint hearings with the Redevelopment Commission and/or the Transportation Authority.<br>The first hearing in January will provide information on when this joint hearing will take place.<br><br>Re:  Long-Range Planning<br>Supervisor Hall asked that departments that are involved in long-range planning provide information on how this information is used.<br><br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS - None<br><br>BOA - None<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Better Neighborhoods Briefing<br><br>Amit Gosh and David Alumbaugh gave a PowerPoint presentation on this briefing.<br><br>John Billovits invited the public to various Market/Octavia Neighborhood Planning Events:<br><br>The first public review plan draft will be held this evening from 6-9 p.m. at the LGBT Center (1800 Market Street - corner of Market and Octavia) on the 2nd Floor in the Rainbow Room.<br><br>On January 12 and January 18, 2003 there will be walking tours for the public.
