<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>150 POWELL STREET</u>&#160;- southeast corner of Powell Street and O'Farrell Street, Lot 22 in Assessor's Block 0327 - The applicant has requested approvals for two alternate, mutually exclusive uses, both of which would demolish three un-rated buildings located on the project site, construct a new building connected to the east side of the existing 150 Powell Street building, and renovate that existing building, rated as Category IV under the Planning Code. The new construction and renovated 150 Powell Street building would be approximately 65 feet high, (four stories), and would include retail space, a 3,600 gross square foot landscaped courtyard, and a lobby on the first floor. Both alternatives require a determination of compliance with the Planning Code pursuant to Section 309, with an exception to loading requirements. No parking would be provided as part of the Project. Alternative (1) would provide ground floor and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for 45 units of time share condominiums, categorized as a "hotel" use under the Planning Code and requiring a Conditional Use authorization. The basement would be used as accessory spa and gymnasium space for fractional ownership ("time-share") residents. This alternative has no parking requirements. Alternative (2) would provide ground floor, basement, and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for 45 dwelling units, all uses permitted as of right. This alternative requires an additional exception under Section 309 (rear yard), and also must obtain variances from residential parking (eleven spaces), dwelling unit exposure, and open space requirements, at a concurrent hearing before the Zoning Administrator. The subject site is within a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District, an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District, and the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District.</font></p>

The proposed project involves the replacement/modernization of a gasoline station and construction of an AM/PM mini-mart, demolition of an existing Smog Pro building, removal and replacement of underground petroleum storage tanks (USTs), and partial site re-grading. The 1,680-gross-square-foot (gsf) project building would result in an approximately 50-gsf expansion of the 24-hour commercial operation. The project would retain the two Mission Street access points, eliminate a Huron Street access, eliminate a Sickles Avenue access near Mission Street, and retain the Sickles Avenue access closest to Huron Street. The approximately 18,000-gsf project site is located in the Outer Mission Neighborhood, is zoned NC-2 (Neighborhood Commercial) and is within the 40-X Height and Bulk District.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Vacations</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She passed out a calendar and requested that Commissioners indicate when they might be off during the summer months.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Sunshine Ordinance Training</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Announced that she received correspondence from the City Attorney's office on a mandatory training session regarding the Sunshine Ordinance on May 6, 2003. A copy of this has been placed in your correspondence folders. Please review it for time and location.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Commission Photos</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She passed out copies of digital photographs taken of the Commission as a group. Asked commissioners to let her know if they are interested in obtaining a copy.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Correspondence to Commissioners</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- When any member of the public emails individual commissioners on matters under the jurisdiction of the Commission, it is important to also copy the Commissioner Secretary. This would eliminate the need for the commissioner to forward a copy to me and it insures that a copy is provided for the public record.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></b></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Commissioner's Comments</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">When he or any commissioner speaks to groups, the opinions expressed are those of the individual and not representative of the Commission as a whole.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: speaking engagements</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It is important that Commissioners inform the Commission Secretary when they receive invitations to speak so the Commission Secretary make sure a quorum of the commission is not involved.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Potential Legislation</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She requested from staff any information on potential legislation or legislative initiatives that come from the Board of Supervisors. This information would be sent to Commissioners prior to the legislation being included in case reports that are given to Commissioners one week before the hearing. If there are any reports or analysis to the Board of Supervisors, this information also be provided to them in advance as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- On Tuesday, the Board voted unanimously to uphold the Commission's decision to uphold the negative declaration. That is why this case will be heard today.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Lakeshore Plaza</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- In 1991, the Commission approved a Conditional Use which was appealed to the Board of Supervisors. The Board placed specific limits on the type and number of restaurants.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This past summer when someone asked if a McDonalds could move in there, the Zoning Administrator issued a letter of determination that the conditions of approval that the Board of Supervisors placed specifically omitted a "hamburger type restaurant."</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This was appealed to the Board of Appeals. Last night his determination that they would require a new conditional use or a modification of a conditional use was upheld on a +3-2 vote. It is likely that a conditional use will come before the Commission.</font></p>

<p><i><font face="Arial" size="2">Re: Glen Park Market Place</font></i></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This case came before the Commission a few months ago, and the Zoning Administrator heard a Variance for parking and open space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The Conditional Use was appealed to the Board of Supervisors and was upheld.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The Variance was appealed to the Board of Permit Appeals and upheld +4-1.</font></p>

The project would be to build a new CAS on the site of the existing facilities. The project would include demolition of 11 of the existing 12 buildings, and the removal of approximately 73 existing parking spaces. The project would retain and rehabilitate Simson African Hall in place. The Academy would retain its general location and orientation. The new facility would include three main levels above grade, two levels below grade, and a loading area at the southwestern portion of the project site. The new Academy building would be approximately 460 feet long and 280 feet wide, with the edges of the roof extending to approximately 520 feet long by 335 feet wide. The building would feature a landscaped roof, the base height of which would be less than 40 feet. Above the base, the landscaped roof would undulate to accommodate the Academy's major programmatic components beneath, with the two peak elements over the planetarium and rainforest exhibits reaching a height of about 67 feet, or approximately 13 feet beyond the highest existing point (Morrison Planetarium). These two peaks would be set back approximately 150 feet from the roof's edge along Academy Drive. Trellised portions of the roof would extend beyond the perimeter walls. The floor area would increase from approximately 350,000 sq. ft. to approximately 390,000 sq. ft. The footprint would decrease from approximately 240,000 sq. ft. to approximately 205,500 sq. ft. This increase in area on a smaller footprint is possible because the plans significantly increase basement level areas.

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Mark Longwood - SNAFU</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Staff mentioned that Sprint had more antenna sites than Verizon.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There is a saturation of antennas in the City.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The need is described by the neighborhood. And in this case, there is no need expressed by the neighbors.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Catherine Roberts - Member of the San Francisco Green Party</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- People are coming to their senses more and more about this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There are enough questions about these cell phone antennas in a densely populated area such as San Francisco. She feels that the Commission should limit them as much as possible, taking the necessary steps against people's health being harmed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2"><u>VALENCIA GARDENS HOPE VI PUBLIC HOUSING PROJECT.</u>&#160;<b>Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report</b>: Assessor's Block 3546, Lot 2 is approximately five acres and is located at 340-370 Valencia Street on the block bounded by Valencia, Guerrero, 14<sup>th</sup>, and 15<sup>th</sup> Streets in the Mission District of San Francisco. The proposed project would be the demolition of the existing Valencia Gardens public housing project which was found to be an historical resource, including 22 three-story residential buildings containing 246 rental units and 82 surface parking spaces and replacement construction of new public housing. The new construction would consist of 15 three-story buildings and two four-story buildings containing 290 residential units, a community center; a childcare center; a computer learning center; an outdoor child play space and other semi-public community open space; and 86 surface parking spaces. The proposed project would require Conditional Use authorization from the Planning Commission to determine qualification as a Planned Unit Development (PUD) under Section 304 of the City Planning Code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- As it has been seen with another housing project, the tenants in public housing do own cars. There is a great demand for parking in public housing projects. Doubling the population without increasing the parking would cause a great detriment to the health, environment and well being to those concerned. It will increase noise congestion and emissions.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Marilyn Amini - West Portal Residents</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It is important to continue this item because there are a lot of community groups who are not aware of the substance of this proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She does not even know if the Landmark Advisory Board is aware of this information.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She believes that the time limit for the Board of Supervisors has run out as well.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Her neighborhood group has not had an opportunity to have a membership meeting to discuss this.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Silvia Sosa</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She supports the continuance of this item because the affected residents should have time to review and study this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There should be proper community input.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ernestine Weiss</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She would like to have this item approved. It will make affordable housing available for those most in need.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Jill Kent</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She supports this continuance also because many of the residents have not been informed.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The neighborhood association has not been informed either.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Time is needed for someone from staff to come out to the neighborhoods and explain what all this is about.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Most of the information was taken from past information. Information should be more updated.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Mike DeCastro</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He has been fighting in-law apartments for many years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- In-law apartments increase congestion and cause problems.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Steven Currier - Outer Mission Residents Association</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- His organization supports this continuance because not many of the members know about this item being heard today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He welcomes members of staff to come to his organization and talk about this item.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- A map would be helpful to help people understand and educate themselves on it.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Steve Johns</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He supports the continuance because this is a huge issue and it would take months for dialog and conversation between members of associations.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Ron Miguel</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He supports the continuance because people do not have a vision yet of what is to be done.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is not speaking for or against it but he definitely supports a continuance.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Mary Ann Miller - SPEAK</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She has always hoped to have secondary units in the Sunset District because this area is a zoning category RH-1(S) and single-family property owner's would be allowed these secondary units.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Not having the parking garage for the extra unit could be a problem.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Wade Crowfoot - Legislative Aid for Supervisor Peskin</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This legislation has been at the Planning Department for over a year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It is very important to hear from the Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It would be beneficial as changes are contemplated to have a framed dialogue.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The Supervisor's office is totally committed to go to neighborhoods and talk to people about this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He feels that it would be very productive to have a hearing today.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">PUBLIC HEARING:</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Wade Crowfoot - Legislative aid for Supervisor Peskin</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Supervisor Peskin would have wanted to attend this hearing but he is at a Budget Committee meeting.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- They have had an opportunity to discuss this legislation with various community organizations, landlords, etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Secondary units don't require additional funding or extra land. They provide modern, safe homes for seniors, living space for students or singles, etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It is not the intent of the Supervisor's office to police the units that are already built. This is meant to increase the housing stock in San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- If there are units in a building subject to rent control, they will continue to be controlled. If they are not subject to rent control, then they will not be controlled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Homeowners would have to pay a $5,000 in lieu affordability fee or subject the unit to affordability requirements.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- If there are enough negative impacts then this legislation would be cancelled.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- To ensure that homeowners are not expanding the envelope to have secondary units, requirements would be controlled.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Alex Ku</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is in agreement with this proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- If the City passed a law for handicap access it would be difficult to add extra units. Not all units should be required to have handicap access.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This proposal is very good except for the issue of handicap access.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Mike DeCastro</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He and his wife have lived in St. Mary's Park for many years.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The reason he purchased his house is because the area is very residential and is a single-family neighborhood.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It is his belief that the quality of life and equity of homes would be destroyed if this legislation were to be approved.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This is a lifestyle and equity-damaging proposal as well.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Julie Hagelshaw - Westwood Park Association</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She submitted a letter from Danny Burks, president of the association who is not in support of this legislation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Norman Rolfe</font></b></p>

<p><font face='"Arial"' size="2">- He can anticipate issues from the public regarding this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- If you provide the parking you get a car if you don't provide a parking space you get rid of the car.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There are a lot of people in San Francisco who do not have cars.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Ann Marie Conroy</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There has been a lack of meaningful outreach and lack of communication to homeowners regarding this legislation before the Planning Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Every homeowner that is targeted on the map provided by staff should have been notified and given the opportunity to come to this hearing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The issue of CC and R should be looked at closely.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This legislation lacks provisions for off-street parking.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Bob Planthold</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He supports this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is a single parent raising two children who will be leaving home. Once children are gone there is no need for two or three bedrooms.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This City has a large population of seniors. There is a long list for subsidized housing. Not everyone who is nearing retirement is low income. This legislation would allow and provide a unit small enough for a single senior person to have a safe and private living space.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This will also allow homeowners help with their financial situation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Dan Kalb - San Francisco Tomorrow</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Additional housing will happen one way or another.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The question is what type of housing and when will it happen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This legislation is quite modest.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Housing in transit areas just makes sense.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- More affordable housing opportunities are needed in the City.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This is a smart proposal that should be approved quite quickly.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Shannon Dodge</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She supports this legislation and is glad that it is finally before the Commission.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- As a homeowner now, she is the kind of person who would like to have a secondary unit because it would help her financially.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Every reasonable tool needs to be used to make more affordable housing.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Kate White - San Francisco Housing Coalition</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She would like to see ways to get rents to go down and to have more affordable units.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Secondary units are a great way to accommodate immigration, extended families, etc.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Gabriel Metcalf - Deputy Director of SPUR</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Every neighborhood needs to be asked to do their part and be moderate about allowing more people to live in their neighborhoods.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There could be no additional housing units with more visual impacts than this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Anybody who opposes this will oppose anything.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Phil Tai - Executive Director of the Asian Law Caucus</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- His organization supports this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There are numerous people who come to his organization speaking of unsafe units.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The units under this legislation will be held under a strict order of conduct.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The City needs more housing supply.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Robin Levitt - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He read a letter from Ashley Hamlett of the Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association who is in full support of this legislation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Brandon Baunach - Housing Action Coalition/Bicycle Coalition</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Working professionals who do not make enough to own a home would be given the opportunity to own a home if there was income from a secondary unit.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Jim Chappell - President of SPUR</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Housing in San Francisco is the most important need.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- SPUR strongly supports this well crafted ordinance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He would like to be able to live on a ground floor where there will not be any stairs.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Very few people who live in in-law type apartments have cars.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Dean Larson</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is a professional artist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It has been very difficult for he and his partner to move into his recently purchased home. He has been hammered from many sides for a lot of expenses. If they were allowed to put in a secondary unit, it would help their financial situation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) John Bardis - Inner Sunset Action Committee</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This hearing is taking place without an environmental review on this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The housing element is pending and this legislation will be implemented into the element.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This public hearing is premature.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Judy Berkowitz - Chair of the Land Use Committee</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The committee voted unanimously against this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The addition of an ancillary unit would cause a lot issues because it cannot be enforced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She recommends that the Commission vote against this.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Marilou Lascari - West Portal Resident</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She would like the Commission to exempt West Portal from this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- They already have a better neighborhood. West Portal does not need to be destroyed.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Maria Souza</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She is a resident of the Richmond District.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Her board has not considered this legislation before.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- A number of the single-family homeowners have asked her to come out to the Planning Commission and represent them at the hearing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She would like the Commission to continued this item and give them an opportunity to discuss this.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Jessie Lorenz - Independent Living Resource Center</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- They support this legislation because San Francisco has a housing crisis for seniors and people with disabilities.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Everyone in this room will need a place to live where they can have their own entrance and be safe.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This is a big step to solve a huge crisis.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Dave Bisho - Westwood Highlands Association</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This proposal has the most far-reaching implications he has ever seen.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- I should feel lucky since my neighborhood will be exempt from this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Whether a neighborhood is exempt or not, there will be implications because of traffic impacts.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Jill Kent</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- They have not been informed or contacted about this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This change will affect everyone in West Portal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This ordinance will increase density and this causes more crime, etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Most of the areas in San Francisco will be affected.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Stephen Johns - Preserve Our Neighborhood</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is concerned that there has been a lack of notice. There are a whole number of people who will be affected from this.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The proper thing to do is to notify people about a decision before the decision is made.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This decision should be postponed or disapproved. He feels that the Supervisors are the ones who should have notified people and they have not.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Gwyneth Borden - SF Chamber of Commerce</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She supports this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This is not an easy decision, but we live in a City and everyone should do his or her share.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There is a need for low-income and moderate-income housing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- People will be given an opportunity to either build a secondary unit in there home or not.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Adena Rosmarin - Board of Directors, Lakeshore Acres Improvement Club</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This legislation is erroneously described.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- The categorical exemption is in error.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- It needs more environmental review.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- If this passes, it rewrites a portion of the Planning Code.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Further environmental review with adequate mitigation measures needs to be addressed.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Karen Niglio - Merced Manor Property</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She lives in the range where her neighborhood will be affected.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She found out about this by a neighbor.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There was no proper notice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There are a lot of people who will be affected and were not notified.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- At the very best, she is asking the Commission to oppose this legislation or at the very least, have this matter continued to have proper notice and proper review.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Erik Quezada - MAC</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- In concept, he supports this legislation. It is clear that the City should find many ways to have more units.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Everyone has to do his or her part to improve this City.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Harold Bright - Architectural Review Committee of the Forest View Association</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There was no proper notice. He does not know how the Department can rezone most of the neighborhoods in the City and not provide proper notice.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Requiring someone to communicate with their neighbors if adding a secondary unit should be included in the legislation.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Hiroshi Fukuda</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He is very concerned because it appears that the entire Richmond district will be affected by this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This will be nice for people who already own a house.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Some of the people who will be living in these secondary units will own cars.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Neighbors should be notified as well -- not just special interest groups.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Ken Kruszka</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Families are getting squeezed out of San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- He urges the Commission to rework the legislation to encourage families to return to live in San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This legislation will not solve the housing problems in San Francisco.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(-) Lois DeCastro</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She opposes this proposal.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This proposal will steal the right many people purchased.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+) Joan Girardot</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She cannot support this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This is unfair, arbitrary and not forcible.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- This needs notification and voting by the property owners.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial" size="2">(+/-) Sue Hestor</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She believes in secondary units.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- Substantial value will be conferred to property owners.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- How land values will be changed has not been really looked at.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- There should be a way to provide fees to MUNI if a secondary unit is built.</font></p>

<p><font face="Arial" size="2">- She feels that the Commission is getting the idea that the neighbors are against any type of construction in the area.
