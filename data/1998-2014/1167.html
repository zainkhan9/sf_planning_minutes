        of retail space would be provided with access from Folsom Street. The 
        proposed project would also require a rear yard modification and a variance 
        from dwelling unit exposure requirements. The site is within an RSD (Residential/Service) 
        South of Market Mixed-Use District, and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District.

        <p><u>829 FOLSOM STREET</u><font class="heading2"> - </font>south side

          in Assessor's Block 3752 - <font class="heading2">Requests for Variances.</font> 
          The proposal is to construct a nine-story, mixed-use building with up 
          to 69 dwelling units, up to 5,000 gross square feet of ground floor 
          commercial space and a 62-space parking garage. A rear yard modification 
          is sought under Section 134(e) to provide rear yard open space within 
          an inner court and on a 7th floor setback of 10-15 feet along Shipley 
          Street. A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, 
          as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements 
          for an open area as defined under Section 140(a)(2) for dwelling unit 
          exposure, and 27 of the 70 units have no exposure other than this inner 
          court. The site is within an RSD (Residential/Service) Mixed-Use District, 
          and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District. </p>

      <p>2. Commission Comments/Questions</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner William Lee:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: 170 St. Germain </i></p>
      <p>- He requested input from either the Planning Department or the Building 
        Department regarding the demolition and if it was done in compliance from 
        the permits issued.</p>
      <p>- He received another letter form Walter Kapland again mentioning that 
        the contractor exceeded the scope of work.</p>
      <p>- What are the procedures on having a re-hearing?</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><font class="heading2">Deputy City Attorney Cleveland-Knowles responded:</font></p>
        <p>- There is no existing provision in the Planning Code for a rehearing 
          or a reconsideration of an item and there are no provisions specifically 
          in the Planning Commission rules.</p>
        <p>- The Planning Department continues to have jurisdiction over the building 
          permit until the Planning Department sends it back to the Building Department.</p>
        <p>- If the Commission would like to schedule the item again, they can. 
        </p>
        <p>- This calendar would have to be noticed within it's regular time.</p>
        <p><font class="heading2">Director Green responded:</font></p>
        <p>- The statement that was made at the hearing when this item was heard 
          is not true--that the Building Department has not resolved work previous 
          to what was presented at the Commission.</p>
        <p>- He believes that if these issues influenced the Commission's vote, 
          the Commission can decide to bring this back before them at a future 
          date.</p>
        <p>- He does not know how the Building Department has answered these allegations.</p>
        <p>- He will speak to the City Attorney to see what abilities he has to 
          hold this permit.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: Legality of Reinstitution of Controls in the Mission Area.</i></p>
      <p>- He will be receiving an answer regarding this issue.</p>
      <p>- He will report on this in the future.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: 170 St. Germain</i></p>
      <p>- If he understood correctly, the Commission has the right to reschedule 
        a case that had previously been heard by the Commission.</p>
      <ul>
        <ul>
          <ul>
            <p><font class="heading2">Director Green responded:</font></p>
            <p>- The Commission has the right to reschedule an item.</p>
          </ul>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>
      <p>- So the Commission could rescind it's decision, take the item off calendar, 
        etc.?</p>
      <p>- He recommends that the item be scheduled on the October 7, 2004 calendar.</p>
      <p>- The basis of the request is that if this is a frivolous assertion or 
        it has merit, the commission needs to decide on this case dependent upon 
        the facts.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commission Antonini:</font></p>
      <p>- If some resolution is found prior to that date, the project should 
        not be held up because of the calendared item.</p>

        <p>- This would be a tough call for the Planning Department because staff 
          will be preparing for a hearing, dealing with the Building Department 
          and trying to find out what is the case regarding the other permit because 
          the permit in question was not the permit that was before the Commission. 
          It would be difficult to make a decision prior to the suggested calendared

          report the information we are aware of at that time. The Commission 
          can acknowledge if this is something they need to reconsider or if it 
          is something that has been resolved and no longer needs to be heard. 
          Scheduling this on September 2, would allow the Commission and staff

      <p>- They support an off street parking Variance and one-to-one bicycle paring.</p>

      <p>- This project is quite adequate since it provides more housing than parking.</p>

      <p>- Housing units without car parking are more affordable.</p>

      <p>- They requested that the project sponsor work collaboratively with DPT and DPW to enliven the expansive right of way since it is not a standard sidewalk width.  This could be done through the use of landscaping, street trees, pedestrian scaled lighting, seating, special pavement treatments, etc.</p>

      <p>- He suggested that they provide bicycle parking as well.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Approved with Conditions as Amended: 1) The BMR units required as part of the inclusionary ordinance would not be the units that are adjacent to the deepest portions of the light well.</p>

      <ul><p><u>83 McALLISTER STREET</u> - south side between Leavenworth Street and 7th Street N., Lot 32, in Assessor's Block 351<font class="heading2"> - </font>Request for <font class="heading2">dwelling unit exposure and parking variances </font>for the subject property, which is in the C-3-G Zoning District and a 80-X Height and Bulk District.  The Zoning Administrator will hear the variance application concurrently with the Planning Commission. The proposal is to seismically upgrade the subject five-story office building (The Methodist Book Concern, a contributor to the Civic Center Historic District, and a Category I Building under the Downtown Plan); and convert the existing office use to approximately 60 small dwelling units, with ground floor retail and lobby space, and supporting residential services on the basement level.  No parking would be provided, and no exterior alterations to character-defining facades are proposed, therefore no Certificate of Appropriateness would be required for this project.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S): See Speakers for Item 11a.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Acting Zoning Administrator closed the public hearing and believes there are grounds for granting the variance and will recommend that the Zoning Administrator do so.  He will also recommend that the designation of units be mixed throughout and at least 10 bicycle parking spaces be added to the project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Donna Hitchens - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

      <p>- She has lived here for 25 years.  The primary light and air is on the side that faces the project and it will be blocked.</p>

      <p>- This is really an issue of the light and air available to their home.</p>

      <p>- She realizes that the project sponsor has the right to renovate and make a profit.</p>

      <p>- They set up a meeting with the project sponsor after the last continuance.  They made an offer and have not received a counter offer from them.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bob Baum - Project Architect</font></p>

      <p>- The developer does not comply with Prop M or the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p>- There is more than one neighbor who opposes the project.</p>

      <p>- He displayed diagrams of the project showing that the proposed project is not comparable in height and bulk.</p>

      <p>- They have prepared a model which displays a project that is in compliance with the Residential Design Guidelines and consists of good neighbor policies.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mark Madsen</font></p>

      <p>- He lives on 30<sup>th</sup> Street.</p>

      <p>- He has a business at home and relies on the light coming into his work area.</p>

      <p>- He does not oppose to the remodel but he does oppose the size and bulk of it.</p>

      <p>- The developers will not be their neighbors since they will just remodel and leave.  The neighbors have a long time interest in the area.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) JoAnne Madsen</font></p>

      <p>- They have made improvement to their home keeping within the neighbors wishes.</p>

      <p>- They enjoy natural light in four bedrooms.  This light really opens up the house and makes it look larger and warmer.</p>

      <p>- Their picturesque windows will look into a wall.</p>

      <p>- They will loose much of the charm and appeal of their home.</p>

      <p>- Her garden has been a tenure project for many years.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor has continued with their project with disregard to the issues exposed by the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- Please preserve the neighborhood and her garden by not approving this proposal.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Claire Piltcher</font></p>

      <p>- She funded Friends of Noe Valley about 30 years ago.</p>

      <p>- She has worked closely with [many] developers and she has concerns.  The revised Residential Design Guidelines are not being met (and knows the older version by heart).</p>

      <p>- This is clearly a demolition and it is happening all over the city.</p>

      <p>- If there isn't some relief given to these neighbors, they will have to appeal the decision.</p>

      <p>- The DR requestors have not been given the opportunity for a light well or a set back.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Darlene Crisp</font></p>

      <p>- She has lived in the neighborhood for many years.</p>

      <p>- This project conflicts with the City's Master Plan.</p>

      <p>- This massive construction will increase the rental rate and selling price for properties.</p>

      <p>- The size of the building is completely out of scale with the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The massive expansion in the rear yard will block sunlight to the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- If one lived next door to this project, one would not like to have their lifestyle affected.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jace Levinson</font></p>

      <p>- The impact will be detrimental.</p>

      <p>- This proposal is just too huge and it will impact the adjacent building.</p>

      <p>- While the Planning Code allows the size of this project, it is not required.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Tom Mogensen - Upper Noe Neighbors</font></p>

      <p>- They support the Discretionary Review because the project does not respect the character of the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- It seems that the matter here is not having bedrooms but how big these bedrooms should be.</p>

      <p>- He suggests that the Commission take Discretionary Review.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Sanger - Representing the Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- Often when there is a renovation, it will impact the adjacent neighbors in some way.</p>

      <p>- The project will extend 13 feet in the rear and will be set back.</p>

      <p>- A neighbor did a similar project in 2002 and it did not include a setback.</p>

      <p>- The Residential Design Guidelines allows what is being proposed.</p>

      <p>- The project will not have an intrusion in the mid block open space.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) James Aaron - Project Architect</font></p>

      <p>- The intent of the project was to not impact the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- He has not had an opportunity to view the model that was presented by the Discretionary Review requestor's representative so he has not been able to verify the scale.</p>

      <p>- The project has a very convectional design.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

      <p>- Staff approved this project not because of developer power.</p>

      <p>- His house is right next to a very blank wall.  We live in a city so it is hard to avoid these types of situations.</p>

      <p>- If this situation was really about light and air, the way the project is being designed, this has no impact at all.</p>

      <p>- Many of the neighbors in Noe Valley are not here and they are not here for a reason.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Mark McGee - Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- He is not going to apologize for what he does.</p>

      <p>- He is not a developer.</p>

      <p>- He just wants to remodel a house.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that the Commission sees that they are just trying to make a living.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Richie Hart - Residential Builders Association</font></p>

      <p>- He has known the Project Sponsor for many years.</p>

      <p>- What they are asking is very reasonable.</p>

      <p>- There is a housing crisis and this project will increase housing.</p>

      <p>- He strongly recommends that the Commission approve this project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Keith - Residential Builders Association</font></p>

      <p>- If the DR requestor's logic prevails, they would not be able to live in the house that they live in.</p>

      <p>- The idea that the Project Sponsor's project impacts light and air is not adequate.</p>

      <p>- Many people support this project and he hopes that the Commission will support it as well.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe Cassidy</font></p>

      <p>- He has been building in Noe Valley for many years.</p>

      <p>- There is always a fight.</p>

      <p>- He knows the Project Sponsor and knows that they are building a great project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Grace Shanahan</font></p>

      <p>- The McGees are long time builders in the Noe Valley area and they are very respectful of what they build.</p>

      <p>- She encourages the Commission to support the project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Dave O'Keiff</font></p>

      <p>- He has built small projects in the area.</p>

      <p>- It seems that when someone remodels or builds a larger home it automatically becomes a monster home.</p>

      <p>- Many neighbors are more than happy with this project because it will increase their property value.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that this is not just a view issue.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Reed Caroll</font></p>

      <p>- The project is comparable to other projects.</p>

      <p>- The project is consistent with adjacent properties.</p>

      <p>- This project should be applauded and supported instead of being rejected.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Sean Keigran</font></p>

      <p>- This project is one aspect of an overall housing crisis.</p>

      <p>- Communities should accept all types of houses.</p>

      <p>- If the housing crisis needs to be solved, all housing projects should be accepted.</p>

      <p>- He has not heard anything that is substantial at this hearing.</p>

The parking provides the potential for one-to-one residential bicycle parking which will be secure in the garage as well as add 108 additional units of market rate affordable car free and car light housing.</p>

      <p>- The only issue they have is the inclusion of the 10 non accessory commercial project spaces in the project.  They oppose this because the project is located in an excellent local and regional transit services area.</p>

      <p>- According to the Architectural Heritage Foundation, his house was the first to be built on that block.</p>

      <p>- The proposed project would be the largest on the block.  It is too large and will overwhelm and denigrate their home.</p>

      <p>- The four story modern building is too large.</p>

      <p>- It is another &quot;Richmond Special&quot;</p>

      <p>- She asks the &quot;professional&quot; developer to limit the project to three stories and retain the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association</font></p>

      <p>- He feels that &quot;alterations&quot; are sometimes deceptive.  This has major alterations.</p>

      <p>- Families are leaving San Francisco because there are not enough single-family homes.</p>

      <p>- Thousands of homes have been taken off the market.</p>

      <p>- Recent studies have indicated that San Francisco is behind in providing housing.  </p>

      <p>- This project is not going to help people who need moderate housing.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jerod Eigerman - Reuben and Junius</font></p>

      <p>- The project sponsor is not a professional developer.</p>

      <p>- The project is code compliant.</p>

      <p>- He has no knowledge of any agreement with Jake McGoldrick.</p>

      <p>- Discretionary Review is for extraordinary circumstances.  Good neighbor gestures have been made in this case.</p>

      <p>- What they are asking for is not outlandish.</p>

      <p>- There is nothing in the guidelines that states that if there is one building on one side you cannot build higher.</p>

      <p>- There is no peculiar hardship because they are on the south side.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Reza Khoshnevisan - Project Architect</font></p>

      <p>- Regarding the demolition, if a floor were to be added, the entire foundation would have to be replaced.</p>

      <p>- There is no way that the fourth floor would be visible.</p>

      <p>- He is available if the Commission has any questions.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approve the project with the following conditions:  The modifications included:</p>

            <ul><ul><ul><p>&#183; Eliminate the fourth floor;</p>

            <p>&#183; Continue the side setback at the rear of the southern side down to the roof of the ground level to match the existing setback and allow for light and air to the DR Requestor's window;</p>

            <p>&#183; Provide an interior connection between the &quot;Common Room&quot; on the first floor (garage level) and the second floor; and</p>

            <p>&#183; Require an NSR be recorded to restrict the &quot;Common Room&quot; on the first floor from becoming an illegal unit.</p>
