    </ul><p>10. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <ul><p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Information provide by Commissioner Bill Lee last week</i></p>

      <p>- He thanked Commissioner Bill Lee for distributing the report from the Committee on Jobs of the San Francisco City and County Budget.</p>

      <p>- The most interesting item in the report is that the 300 million dollar shortfall was not a one time situation but rather endemic of a structural problem in the budget and is evidenced that there has been a huge increase in the size of the work force from 1995 to 2003; and our per capita spending is far in excess of other cities.</p>

      <p>- he has taken part in a study that was done in 2001 and this was exacting the finding when they compared the cities of San Jose and San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- He would like to calendar a discussion in the future of this particular study.  It does ask a lot of questions regarding the sort of things the Commission does in terms of approving projects, housing policies, etc.  Do these decisions influence the budget of the City?</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner William Lee</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Landmarks Advisory Board</i></p>

      <p>- Last week there was a presentation from the Landmarks Board.</p>

      <p>- Is there enough staffing allocation for historic preservation and for someone to get a Certificate of Appropriateness?</p>

        <ul><p><b><i>Acting Director Badiner responded:</i></b></p>

        <p>- The answer is no.</p>

        <p>- There have been two staff positions lost in that unit.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>11. Director's Announcements</p>

      <ul><p><i>Re:  Acting Director and Acting Acting Acting Zoning Administrator</i></p>

      <p>- He will be wearing two hats today and is asking for the Commission's patience.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein</i></p>

      <p>- Acknowledged and thanked Commissioner Feldstein who brought four very large and very delicious cakes in appreciation of staff.</p>

  </ul></ul><p>12.  Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

      <p><b>(+) Larry Paul - Representing Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- He showed various photographs of how the project would look compared to the adjacent homes.</p>

      <p>- He also displayed pages from the Residential Design Guidelines showing how the project could be changed to be in conformance with the guidelines.</p>

      <p>- By having a top floor setback it would lessen the impact of the building.</p>

      <p>- The rear deck is quite large and does not need to come all the way out.  It could be cut out a few feet.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Pelavin</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on this street.</p>

      <p>- There is a deck on the second floor on the north side.  This deck should be removed because from it one could look straight into his dining room.  There is not much need for that deck.</p>

      <p>- If this deck is not removed, he would like to have some privacy lattice installed so there is no view into his dining room.</p>

      <p>- This project takes away one of three off street parking spaces.  If there are additional cars with this house, that will create a problem.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Amanda Hillery</b></p>

      <p>- She is concerned with the general character of the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned about the footpath that runs to the north of the proposed property.</p>

      <p>- This is like a green oasis and is used by the general public.  There are some undesirable rodents and they might be displaced if this project is approved.</p>

      <p>- There have been landslides due to erosion.  She would like to be ensured that the proper measures will be taken to not have any of the neighbors be impacted by the instability of the soil.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jackie Pelavin</b></p>

      <p>- Many of the neighbors have been there for many, many years.</p>

      <p>- The proposed house will create a huge shadow and huge scale impact on her house.</p>

      <p>- The proposed house will be double the size of her house.</p>

      <p>- Every house on this street has setbacks.</p>

      <p>- They are not opposed to the project, but there are changes that she would like the Commission to take into consideration.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned with landslides.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Eugene Barsotti</b></p>

      <p>- He has lived on this street for 41 years.</p>

      <p>- One of the problems with this house is that the lot is designed so that the house could be setback from the sidewalk.</p>

      <p>- He does not understand why the house does not fit the size of the lot.</p>

      <p>- The house will just look completely out of place.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Patricia Barsotti</b></p>

      <p>- She read a letter from her neighbor who is not in support of the project.</p>

      <p>- She could not attend the hearing because she is an elderly, house ridden senior.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Christine Hausson</b></p>

      <p>- She lives right next door to the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- The area has not changed for many, many years.</p>

      <p>- Prior to filing this Discretionary Review, she wrote to the project sponsor and this person failed to comply.</p>

      <p>- She is not opposed to the building; she would like the Commission to look at all the issues presented by the people who are opposed.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Hans Hausson</b></p>

      <p>- This area is noted for landslides.</p>

      <p>- The concern about the slippage is very important to him.</p>

      <p>- There are a lot of eucalyptus trees and these trees do not have deep roots.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned that the roots of these trees will be impacted and can cause a danger to the neighbors.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Charles Cunningham</b></p>

      <p>- Using photographs of  distant views of the area, he showed how the proposed house would compare to the other homes.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned with the probability of slides.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Archie Occhipinti</b></p>

      <p>- If he built the project the way the Discretionary Review requestor's architect asked him to he would be invading the sidewalk by 10 feet.</p>

      <p>- There is no possible way that the DR requestor could see his deck.</p>

      <p>- He has to have an elevator.  There is no way he can get an elevator in a 22 foot pad.</p>

      <p>- He thinks that the architect should take another look.</p>

      <p>- He is curious to know if he has appeal rights.</p>

      <p>- Because the Commission changed their policy regarding Discretionary Reviews, the neighbors were not able to file more DRs.</p>

      <p>- There are extraordinary circumstances because the location is mid block and surrounded by buildings.  It is in a very sensitive spot.</p>

      <p>- The scale and massing is very inappropriate.</p>

      <p>- She presented photographs of the street without the finished project compared to a photograph of the street with the finished project showing how incredibly massive it is and overwhelming for this site.</p>

      <p>- At a minimum, one story of this building should be eliminated.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Tony Rodriguez</b></p>

      <p>- He is representing Dr. Calvert.</p>

      <p>- Dr. Calvert submitted a letter expressing his concerns about this project because he lives near the project site.</p>

      <p>- Part of Dr. Calvert's lot serves as vehicular access and paring for 13 residential units.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Franklin Bowles</b></p>

      <p>- He really wishes that the Commission realizes the grotesqueness of this project.  It is just too large and massive.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jeff Baker</b></p>

      <p>- He and his wife live on Lombard Street.</p>

      <p>- She agrees with all the concerns of the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- No matter what happens, they will be able to maintain their view of Coit Tower.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jerry Mutz</b></p>

      <p>- They overlook the mid-block green space to the north.</p>

      <p>- His interest in this green space is not about views but about cherishing a soft area and their gardens.</p>

      <p>- This area is a home for raccoons and birds and not for an extremely large home.</p>

      <p>- The residents of the block really treasure and appreciate open space, greenery and pathways.</p>

      <p>- This project is just too out-of-scale.  It does not respect greenery and does not fit into the neighborhood. </p>

      <p>- Many of these same neighbors supported an expansion by the previous neighbors that was approved without any Discretionary Review.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Penelope Clark - Co-Chair of the Russian Hill Neighbors</b></p>

      <p>- She submitted a letter from her Board of Directors stating their opposition to this project as it is currently proposed, as well as the variance.</p>

      <p>- Because there is a garage in the buildable area there is no need to put it in another location.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsors have not made any effort to communicate with the neighbors to deal with the issues they might have.</p>

      <p>- There are a lot of beautiful properties in the area.</p>

      <p>- She feels that this home is structurally sound and should not be abolished.</p>

      <p>- The Planning Commission should not allow the demolition of homes and allow something larger to be built.</p>

      <p>- She lives directly across from the subject property.</p>

      <p>- She has lived in the area for 18 years.</p>

      <p>- She and her husband are opposed to this project because it involves demolishing a medium sized home and replacing it with a very large, very massive, four level structure.</p>

      <p>- The new home is completely inappropriate for this neighborhood.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jason Wisner</b></p>

      <p>- This is an extremely large project that is not harmonious with the neighborhood character.</p>

      <p>- He is opposed to the demolition and [the proposed house] should not be allowed.</p>

      <p>- There is an existing property that can be refurbished.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned with a public notice that stated there was to be a hearing on January 22.  That hearing did not happen and was continued to this date.  The problem with that is that no one was notified of this continuance.  There probably would be more people here today to speak on this project.  That is why he would like to have this project continued.</p>

      <p>- He is also concerned that when construction is going on and because the street is quite narrow, this could cause problems if there were to be a catastrophe.  He would suggest that the construction equipment be put below the spot where there is a constant bottle neck.</p>

      <ul><p><u>PERMITTING TOURIST HOTELS OF 75 ROOMS OR LESS IN THE SERVICE/SECONDARY OFFICE (SSO) ZONING DISTRICT</u> - Consideration of an Ordinance amending the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Section 818 and adding Section 818.78 to Table 818 to allow a tourist hotel of 75 rooms or less as a principal permitted use in the SSO (Service/Secondary Office District; adopting findings of consistency with the priority polices of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Disapproval with recommendations.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(+) Bill Barns - Office of Supervisor Daly</b></p>

      <p>- Supervisor Daly supports the recommendation of planning staff.  Approvals through Conditional Use is a good idea.  Supervisor Daly also believes that by making it through Conditional Use, the question of displacing PDR is addressed.  The Commission would have to have a hearing if PDR is being displaced.</p>

      <p>- All of the Commission understands that the South of Market community planning process needs a little work.</p>

      <p>- The residents of SOMA are interested in a variety of uses.</p>

      <p>- The SOMA residents do not want the Community Planning Process to inhibit development.</p>

      <p>- This legislation is appropriate while the Community Planning Process is finalized.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Jim Meko - SOMA Leadership Council</b></p>

      <p>- The staff recommendation is flawed.  If staff included more facts the recommendation would have been approval with some recommendations.</p>

      <p>- All seven Commissioners have approved removing SOMA from the Eastern Neighborhoods process.  Now staff has gone ahead and taken the areas back into the process without approval of the Commission.</p>

      <p>- Staff is considering a radical down zoning of the area and some of the western South of Market.</p>

      <p>- This kind of legislation should be based on the context of a healthy mixed use and not isolating PDR.</p>

      <p>- Western SOMA was removed from the Eastern Neighborhoods process because the process was unresponsive to how the residents envision the future of SOMA.  No one supports Core PDR.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to approve the legislation.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Ernesto Cerrillos</b></p>

      <p>- He has been a hotel worker for many years.</p>

      <p>- He is in favor of building small hotels.</p>

      <p>- There would be more opportunities for employees.</p>

      <p>- San Francisco is a beautiful city and this would provide a large income for the City.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Circe Sher - Metrovation</b></p>

      <p>- She has been working with Supervisor Daly to allow a hotel on her property.</p>

      <p>- She believes that the site on 5th and Townsend has evolved into a good site for a hotel.</p>

      <p>- There are great amenities in the area to support a hotel.</p>

      <p>- The hotel would have 50 rooms and the design would be elegant and historical.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Wayne Wilson - 655 5<sup>th</sup> Street Homeowners Association</b></p>

      <p>- Everyone in the association is in support of this legislation because we believe it will bring vitality to the neighborhood.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Mark Dumolien - 695 5<sup>th</sup> Street Homeowners Association</b></p>

      <p>- He echoed Wayne Wilson's comments.</p>

      <p>- Hotels provide 24% foot traffic and it fits with the live/work businesses and others in the area.</p>

      <p>- He support the legislation.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Peter Morse - Townsend Association LLC</b></p>

      <p>- He owns a business in the area and has seen how it has developed.</p>

      <p>- This legislation would not displace any PDR uses.</p>

      <p>- There is a lot of talk about whether the neighborhood should be exclusive PDR.  He is unaware of the discussions on this subject.</p>

      <p>- The hotel will enhance the mixed uses in this vibrant neighborhood.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Mark Seiler</b></p>

      <p>- His major concern is that he has not been involved in the community planning process.</p>

      <p>- His concern is that his property will be down zoned and this will have a negative impact on him.</p>

      <p>- He would like to be included in the community planning process.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Baker</b></p>

      <p>- He displayed a map of SOMA explaining how it is so out of date.  But this map was printed form the database.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Sue Hestor - Hotel Workers Local 2</b></p>

      <p>- There is no compelling reason to do this outside the completion of the South of Market planning process</p>

      <p>- The hotel workers really track what is going on in the hotel industry.</p>

      <p>- Right now the hotel industry is going through a tough time.  There is a high number of vacancies.</p>

      <p>- The focus was misplaced in the staff analysis.</p>

      <p>- It is totally proper to have a finding in this area.</p>

      <p>- Local 2 is against this legislation and is against anything that would take away any of the Conditional Use provisions.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Jaime Rossi - Chamber of Commerce</b></p>

      <p>- He submitted a letter from neighbors who are in support of the project.</p>

      <p>- Any plans to extend CalTrain would have to stop at 4<sup>th</sup> and Townsend.</p>

      <p>- The area is a truly a mixed use area.</p>

      <p>- This is going to bring PDR forward and not backward.</p>

      <p>- Hotels create hundreds of construction jobs and jobs within the hotel.</p>

      <p>ACTION: Approved the legislation with recommended modifications that would include requiring Conditional Uses in that area and to not allow hotels on sites where there has been PDR use for the last 18 months.</p>

      <p>- Supervisor Peskin will be proposing at the Land Use Committee the following amendments:  1) the first amendment clarifies what the floor area ratio base is for public buildings meeting a strict criteria for landmark statutes in the ordinance.  The basis of what is used to calculate the amount of TDR that could be available for sale for such a building; 2) where a development lot must be located to transfer P building TDR meeting the historic criteria set forth in the ordinance parallels the existing language in section 128 was omitted in the draft of the ordinance; 3) corrects a missed cross reference which is the old section 5 and is crossed out in the proposed amendment so that the concept of the arts funds could be used on exterior elements needs to be restated at that point in the ordinance.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(-) Denis Driscoll - Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

      <p>- He is requesting that the proposed construction be modified because it will cause a negative impact on his property and it is not consistent with the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p>- With his proposed compromise, he will still loose some light and a window but he is willing to compromise.</p>

      <p>- He showed photographs demonstrating how with the new construction he will loose a large a mount of sunlight to his property.</p>

      <p>- He suggests that they lower the ceiling height from 9 feet to 8 feet.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Joanne Driscoll </b></p>

      <p>- She and her husband are native San Franciscans.</p>

      <p>- Their daughter is allergic to mold and is asthmatic.</p>

      <p>- She requests that their family needs be considered as well.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Leslie Zamarripa</b></p>

      <p>- She owns property on Country Club Drive.</p>

      <p>- She feels that the project that is being proposed is out of scale and will take away from the planned openness.</p>

      <p>- Plans are not customarily read easily.  Once built, projects have proven to be a different matter than what was drawn.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned that the height will diminish light and increase mold to the DR requestor's home.  This will be quite a problem since their daughter is allergic to mold.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Nancy Berger</b></p>

      <p>- She has been a homeowner on  Country Club Drive for many years.</p>

      <p>- She read a letter from a neighborhood who was not able to attend the meeting and is against the construction.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Therese Peffer - Project Designer and Agent</b></p>

      <p>- The proposed addition would only be above the crawl space.</p>

      <p>- They have complied with all of the Planning Codes as well as the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p>- She believes that there will be no impact on the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- She has designed a setback of eight feet.</p>

      <p>- There are several [existing] precedents in the neighborhood (she showed a photograph of a few on that street).</p>

      <p>- She is not clear if the 56 signatures that are not in support of the project saw the project or they are just against construction completely.</p>

      <p>- She does not believe that this addition is exceptional or extraordinarily.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Maria Bonkowski</b></p>

      <p>- The construction is just simply because they need an extra bedroom for their child.</p>

      <p>- There are many homes that have construction additions.  So the neighborhood will change inevitably.</p>

      <p>- The design is harmonious with the other homes.</p>

      <p>- She hopes that the Commission will consider their concerns.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Joseph Bonkowski</b></p>

      <p><b>(+) Rodrigo Galimba - Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- He showed a map of the surrounding neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- He also showed a map of the building to building lot coverage.</p>

      <p>- This house will follow the gradual slope of the hill.</p>

      <p>- The proposed building fa&ccedil;ade will be three stories over a ground floor garage with additional living space on the garden level and in back.</p>

      <p>- The overall mass of the building has been reduced.</p>

      <p>- The design of the building follows the Planning Codes as well as the newly revised Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Jeremy Paul</b></p>

      <p>- There is no opposition to the demolition nor to replace it with housing.</p>

      <p>- There is very little commercial use left on this block.</p>

      <p>- The Project Sponsor is making use of the NC designation to build a building that is far out of scale and character.</p>

      <p>- The building is on a key lot.  This lot has distinct impacts on the surrounding properties.</p>

      <p>- The Residential Design Guidelines addresses these types of lots.</p>

      <p>- The design that is proposed really accommodates the key lot components.</p>

      <p>- A very successful building could be built on this site with a better design.</p>

      <p>- There are Residential Design Guideline issues here as well.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Ruth Bender</b></p>

      <p>- She just moved to Noe Valley.  She loves the character of the neighborhood and the open space.</p>

      <p>- When she looks outside her front door she has sunlight.  If this building is approved she will loose this sunlight.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Steban Guevara</b></p>

      <p>- Demolishing and building such a monolith will send the cost of housing out of reach.</p>

      <p>- The point here is that people should understand that they need to maintain their homes.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned about his garden.  It is an extension of his home and needs to have sunlight all the time.</p>

      <p>- The proposed project will allow the people who will live in that building to look into his garden, bedroom and dining room.</p>

      <p>- She feels that this project is not in compliance with this neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- It will cut out sunlight for many hours.</p>

      <p>- None of the neighbors are in favor of this project.</p>

      <p>- This building will rally change the character of the five houses that will be impacted.</p>

      <p>- This is the first time that she has seen the design of the project.</p>

      <p>- She feels that it would be great to replace the building that is currently there but the proposed replacement building is just too large.</p>

      <p><b>(-) David Robb</b></p>

      <p>- He concurs with everything that everyone has said.</p>

      <p>- Her husband went around the neighborhood to see other key lot homes.</p>

      <p>- He estimated an area of the wall that was taken up by windows.</p>

      <p>- She would like to see other windows being designed on the other side.</p>

      <p>- Going down 30 feet would make a huge difference.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Hussein Safa</b></p>

      <p>- He lives on Dolores Street, right in back of the proposes structure.</p>

      <p>- He is grateful that the facade is similar to the neighborhood character.</p>

      <p> - He would like the Commission to allow a three story building with a lot less windows.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Maria Cordero</b></p>

      <p>- Because of the height of the proposed structure, she will loose a lot of sunlight to her house.</p>

      <p>- The project will also cause mature trees to come down.</p>

      <p>- A three story building will be a good compromise.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Bill Caldwell</b></p>

      <p>- He is not directly impacted by this building, but he does not like the precedent that this project is setting.</p>

      <p>- The large air well causes an invasion of privacy.</p>

      <p>- There are four story building in the neighborhood.</p>
