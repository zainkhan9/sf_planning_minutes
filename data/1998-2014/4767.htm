(Neighborhood Shopping) District is a "paper" district that is no longer mapped.

<p>	10.	98.280ET	(ROSETTER)
<p>		<u>BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN</u>, Consideration of a proposal to
amend the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to
clarify definition of and obligations of the responsible City official and the
landlord regarding the provision of bicycle facilities in or for building space
leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation schedule provisions. 
The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to
require shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and
buildings undergoing major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already
requires bicycle spaces in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is
no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3
(Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be
required by this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential
buildings and buildings primarily used as parking garages.

<p><u>	COUNTY JAIL NO. 3 REPLACEMENT PROJECT</u>, CERTIFICATION OF FINAL
EIR. The project consists of replacing components of the existing San Francisco
County Jail No. 3/7 Complex, on land owned by the City and County of San
Francisco in unincorporated San Mateo County, adjoining the City of San Bruno
to the east, City of Pacifica to the west, Skyline College to the north, and Crystal
Springs Reservoir to the south.  The project mainly involves replacing the
existing County Jail No. 3 building, which contains men's housing, outdoor
exercise yards, kitchen, laundry, medical/dental clinic, and administrative
operations, with new Administrative/Services and Housing Buildings on the
same site.  The project also involves replacing and upgrading other facilities of
the County Jail No. 3/7 Complex, including a new Vehicle Storage Area, new
parking lots, new and upgraded internal access roads, new electrical service
and emergency generator, and water and sanitary sewer infrastructure
improvements.  The existing County Jail No. 3 building would be demolished
after the new buildings are constructed.  The project is proposed by the San
Francisco Sheriff's Department.

<p><u>		475 BRANNAN STREET</u>-- <strong>Certification of Environmental Impact Report.</strong> The
proposal is to renovate and expand an existing office building (former
warehouse) at 475 Brannan Street, between Third and Fourth Streets
(Assessor's Block 3787, lot 31), with addition of parking.   The project would add
two stories to an existing two-story-plus-basement building, increasing floor
area from approximately 180,000 gross square feet (gsf) to about 245,500 gsf. 
Office space would increase from 180,000 gsf to 241,000 gsf, and a portion of
the ground floor would contain approximately 2,500 gsf of retail space.  An
existing 71,000 sq.ft. basement would be converted to a parking garage for
about 160 vehicles.  Off-street loading would be provided through two new
loading docks constructed on the east side of the building and accessible from
Brannan Street via a private on-site alley.  The project would require a rezoning
of the existing 50-foot height limit to 65 feet to permit construction of the project,
which would be up to approximately 58 feet in height.  The rezoning must be
approved by the Board of Supervisors.  This project is located in an SSO
(Service Secondary Office) zoning district.
