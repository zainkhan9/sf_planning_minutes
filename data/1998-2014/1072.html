His comments last week were not directed to the family who had their lives turned around especially when there is construction going on.  His comments were directed towards the professionals who had been hired and who had been given the trust by this family to look out for their interest.  His message is to please be careful when one hires professionals and look for references.  He does not want the professionals thinking that this Commission is a fail-safe mechanism.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOS &ndash; <br>Budget Committee<br>Re:  Release of $263,000--money that was on reserve mainly intended for capital improvement for the Department's computer system.<br>- It was a difficult hearing.

Approval of these parking spaces will not be detrimental to the neighborhood; they will serve existing residential and commercial users and not bring new drivers to the neighborhood.<br>- When MAX limited develops residential units in the future it intends to use all nine spaces for residential purposes.<br>(+) Pam Pester<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has about 20 boxes filled with documents from MAX Limited's previous lawyers documenting the efforts they made over the three years prior to their representation dealing with the DR requestor.<br><br>(+) Maria McFerish<br>- She has a bad relationship with her tenant and this has cost a lot of money and required a lot of changes with the development plans they had for the building.<br>- Part of the unhappiness of the DR requester was that she negotiated an agreement that the floor space of the DR requestor would be reduced.<br>- She needs all the parking spaces and would like to develop the third floor as soon as possible into residential dwellings and will need the parking for these dwellings.<br><br>MOTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Discretionary Review and approve parking with requirement to build dwelling units.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joe, Salinas<br>NAYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim, Fay, Chinchilla, Baltimore<br>RESULT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion Failed<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoharis<br><br>MOTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the project.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fay, Chinchilla, Lim<br>NAYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salinas, Joe, Baltimore<br>RESULT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Motion Failed<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoharis<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the call of the Chair, this matter was continued to June 13, 2002, to allow the absent commissioner to participate in the final action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002.0066D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.
