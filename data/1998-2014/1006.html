Assessor's Block 3732, Lot 62. The site is part of the major city block bounded by Howard Street to the north, Folsom Street to the south, 5th Street to the east, and 6th Street to the west within the South of Market neighborhood. Clementina and Tehama Streets are minor streets bisecting this city block. The proposed project would demolish the existing one-story, 5,000-square-foot warehouse on this 5,625-square-foot site and construct 28 residential condominium units over approximately 1,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of ground-floor commercial space, and eight off-street parking spaces within a new eight-story structure. The proposed structure would be approximately 37,975 sq. ft. and 85 feet in height, an increase of 32,348 sq. ft. and seven stories in height above the existing structure. The project site is located within the RSD (Residential Service Mixed-Use) zoning district and within the 40-X/85-B height and bulk district. Projects within the RSD zoning district require a conditional use authorization to determine the residential density for buildings over 40 feet in height. The project site is also within the South of Market Redevelopment Plan Area.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation: Uphold Preliminary Negative Declaration.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued from Regular Meeting of December 5, 2002)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proposed for Continuance to February 13, 2003)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to February 13, 2003<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradford Bell, Antonini, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.

ROOS: (415) 558-5981)<br>50 OAK STREET, SAN FRANCISCO CONSERVATORY OF MUSIC - Public Hearing on the Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) - The proposed project is the seismic upgrade and major alteration of the existing four- to five- story Category II, Significant Building at 50 Oak Street, and demolition of the adjacent three- to four- story building and new construction of a six-story structure at 70 Oak Street, for the San Francisco Conservatory of Music.  The two structures would be integrated into one, structurally integrated facility. The two existing buildings total about 91,000 gsf.  The Conservatory of Music would contain about 125,000 gsf, including about 19,200 gsf of performance space; 17,000 gsf of performing support space; 26,500 gsf of educational studios and spaces; 7,500 gsf of administrative office pace; 7,000 gsf of library space; 21,600 gsf of corridor and circulation space; and 26,200 gsf of service and storage space. Of the total area, about 98,500 gsf are applicable to the FAR under the Planning Code. No parking spaces or loading spaces are proposed.  The site occupies the north side of Oak Street, between the 25 Van Ness Avenue building and a parking lot at Hickory and Franklin Street, encompassing most of the half block bounded by Oak, Hickory, and Franklin Streets and Van Ness Avenue.  The site includes Lots 5 and 7, in Assessor's Block 834.  While the project would function as one building, it would appear as two buildings from Oak Street.  The project requires a lot line adjustment to merge the existing lots; a Permit to Alter for 50 Oak Street, a Category II, Significant Building, under Planning Code, Article 11; review of substantial alterations to existing buildings in the C-3 Districts under Section 309, including a request for exceptions to bulk limits (for maximum building length and maximum diagonal dimension), and a revocable encroachment permit from the Department of Public Works, to occupy sub sidewalk vaults. <br>Preliminary Recommendation:  Receive Comments.

Assessor&rsquo;s Block 6544 Lot 012 -  Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.04.12.2804, to construct horizontal additions to the west side and rear and add a new third story.  The Project will significantly change the facade of the building and change the roofline from a flat roof to a gabled roof for a single family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential House, 2 Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.    <br>Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Modify the Project<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) Linda Alperstein &ndash; Discretionary Review Requestor<br> - Since the filing of this Discretionary Review.  A lot of negotiations have been made between her and the project sponsor.<br>- They are really close to coming to an agreement.<br>- The only one issue she is still concerned about is the rear, flat portion of the roof of the project sponsor's home.<br>- If the project sponsor follows the plans that they have, it will impact all her east facing windows.  She has compromised quite a bit.<br>- Even if the project sponsor keeps their flat room above her floor level, it would cause an impact.<br>- She would just like the height of the roof not raised so much.<br>(-) Tom Abels &ndash; Project Architect for DR Requestor <br>- He displayed diagrams of the project.<br>- The issues are focused on the height of the flat room at the rear of the house.<br>- The project sponsor would be happy to keep the flat roof and build a deck, but this would be 2 feet higher than what the Discretionary Review requester could agree to.<br>- Also, the Discretionary Review requester would agree to have the handrails on the proposed deck be of a light weight screen or Plexiglas to allow as much air and light to come through.<br>(-) Claire Pilcher<br>- She has one item she would like to have recognized, the deck appeared on top of the rear flat roof later in the plans.  <br>- She believes that a deck would defeat the purpose since anything could be put up on this deck.<br>(+) Edward Mullins &ndash; Project Sponsor<br>- He and his wife have lived in Noe Valley for many years.<br>- They did not purchase their home to sell it later and make a profit.  This is their home which they would like to live in it.<br>- He displayed diagrams of how the project would look if approved by the Planning Department.<br>- They have made many modifications to the plans to accommodate the Discretionary Review requestor.<br>(+) Philip Whitehead &ndash; Project Designer and Engineer<br>- He believes that the issues the Discretionary Review requestor has are mostly related to blockage of view.<br>(+) Joseph Marchand<br>- The project sponsors should be allowed to go through with their project.<br>- This project has been held up for over a year now.<br>- This renovation will improve the area.<br>(+) John Rdelo<br>- He has been a long time resident of Noe Valley.<br>- The project sponsors are very good neighbors.<br>- He would like to ask the Commission to allow the project sponsor to do what the code allows them to do.<br>(+) Father Michael Healy &ndash; Pastor of St. Phillip the Apostle Catholic Church<br>- The project sponsors are quite open to a compromise and want to be good neighbors.<br>- The problem that he faces in his parish is that families have to move away because they cannot afford to purchase homes. <br>- He supports these parishioners who want to invest in Noe Valley.<br>(+) Eric Rupe<br>- He described general architectural aspects of the project.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took Discretionary Review and approved with amendment by project sponsor:  (which does not include a 2 foot height reduction in the rear).<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradford Bell, Antonini, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.

Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.05.14.6488, to construct 2 and 5 foot horizontal additions to the rear, and bays to the front and north side of the existing dwelling.  The Project would also add a room on the top floor and increase the height of the building by changing the existing gable roof with a flat roof.  The proposal includes a roof top deck in the front of the northerly half of the roof accessible by stairs enclosed in a roof top stair penthouse for a single family dwelling in an RH-2 (Residential House, 2 Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.    <br>Preliminary Recommendation:  Do Not Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) David Wiliamson &ndash; Discretionary Review Requestors<br>- He would like to have three changes:  (1) reduce the size of the wall by half; (2) ensure that the fence surrounding their home not be damaged; (3) reduce the parapet about one foot from the bay so they will be able to obtain more sunlight.<br><br>(-) Mrs. Wiliamson<br>- She displayed diagrams of the proposed project to emphasize how she would like the parapet reduced in height so she can receive more light.<br>(-/+) Mike Masuko<br>- This proposed project is next door to a house, which the Planning Department allowed to be built, that is tremendously high.<br>- He is watching his neighbors discuss this issue, which the Commission created.<br>- The Commission should really think of their decision on this case.<br>(+) Colleen Bal &ndash; Project Sponsor<br>- They are proposing a very modest project, they want to extend the kitchen in the back 2.5 feet and the back bedroom 5.5 feet &ndash; this respects the setbacks in the back.  They are also adding a roof deck.<br>- She feels that the Discretionary Review requestor is the only person in the neighborhood who is opposing the project.  All other neighbors support their project, even the neighborhood association.<br>- She feels that the Discretionary Review requestor is concerned more about view than about light and air.<br>(+) Alex Terry &ndash; Project Sponsor and Architect<br>- The parapet is needed because of fire safety and they have kept it at the utmost minimum.<br>- He displayed diagrams of the proposed project.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did not take Discretionary Review and approved as submitted.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradford Bell, Antonini, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.
