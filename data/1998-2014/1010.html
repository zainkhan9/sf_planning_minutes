The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.<br><br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002.1258E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T. CHAN: (415) 558-5982)<br>STONESTOWN VILLAGE PROJECT - 3251 20TH AVENUE - Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report:  The project site is located on the south side of Eucalyptus Drive, immediately west and northwest of the Stonestown Galleria shopping center. The proposal includes a mixed-use development comprising approximately 366,800 gross square feet (gsf) on approximately 13.7 acres primarily used as surface parking for the shopping center.  The proposed development includes both residential and neighborhood-serving retail components.  The residential component includes three five-story, 50-foot-tall apartment buildings, approximately 96,250 gsf, 71,400 gsf, and 62,350 gsf, respectively, with 202 subsurface parking spaces; and a two- to three-story, approximately 30-foot-tall senior care facility, totaling approximately 70,300 gsf, with 17 parking spaces.  The proposed retail component includes development of a 27-foot-tall, 41,600-gsf grocery market, and construction of neighborhood-serving retail spaces totaling approximately 24,900 gsf.  The project would include construction of two parking garages and reconfiguration of two surface parking lots that would contain about 1,684 total commercial parking spaces to replace 1,500 existing commercial spaces displaced by the proposed project construction, and provide 184 net new parking spaces to serve the proposed retail uses. The proposed project would also incorporate landscaping features, such as streetscape connections, landscaped walkways, interior courtyards, and open space. To implement this project, the proposed project would require a Conditional Use authorization (CU) to amend the existing Planned Unit Development (PUD) to modify allowable residential density for the apartment community and potentially modify rear yard setback requirements for both residential components. In addition, an amendment of the Zoning Map would be needed to change the height district from 40 feet to 50 feet. The 13.7-acre project site is located in the Lakeshore neighborhood within Assessor's Block 7295 and includes portions of Lots 21, 22, and 23. The site is primarily within a C-2 (Commercial Business) zoning district, and portions are within a 40-X and 65-D height and bulk districts.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation:  Receive Comments.

This legislation will be considered for a 2nd reading this coming Tuesday, February 18 at which time it will proceed to the Mayor's desk for his signature.  The legislation is only enabling legislation, which would create the appropriate zoning to allow the project itself to proceed through the permitting process.  The next step will be for the project sponsor to submit his building permit and Conditional Use applications to the Department, which this Commission will eventually consider.<br><br>Re:  Special Rules Committee Meeting on Monday, February 10, 2003<br>This was a hearing to consider Supervisor McGoldrick's resolution creating an 11-member Planning Audit Implementation Advisory Group.  As he reported last week, this Advisory Group was proposed in response to a management audit of the Planning Department that was conducted last year by the Budget Analyst.  While the Department agrees with the spirit and intent of the resolution in that the Department is committed to the implementation of the recommendations of the audit, staff did not agree that this would be best carried out by the formation of yet a new deliberative body that would expend additional staff resources.  After some debate, the members of the Rules Committee agreed that the matter might best be handled by this current Planning Commission or by a special Audits Committee of the Board.  The resolution was continued at the call of the chair.<br><br>Re:  Land Use Committee Meeting &ndash; Monday, February 24, 2003 &ndash; 1:00 p.m.<br>1) JFK Drive Saturday Closure &ndash; The Planning Department published a Negative Declaration on November 30, 2002.

Clementina and Tehama Streets are minor streets bisecting this city block. The proposed project would demolish the existing one-story, 5,000-square-foot warehouse on this 5,625-square-foot site and construct 28 residential condominium units over approximately 1,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of ground-floor commercial space, and eight off-street parking spaces within a new eight-story structure.

The project site is located within the RSD (Residential Service Mixed-Use) zoning district and within the 40-X/85-B height and bulk district.
