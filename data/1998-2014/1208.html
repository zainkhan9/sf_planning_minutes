      <p><u>1840 WASHINGTON STREET</u> - Assessor's Block 0599, Lot 008 - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration.  </b>The proposed project involves the construction of an approximately 45,238-gross-square-foot (gsf), eight-story, 80-foot-high residential building, which would include about 31,868 gsf of residential use (29 dwelling units), and 13,370 gsf of parking (35 off-street parking spaces).

    </ul><p>7. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <ul><p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Rincon Hill Plan</i></p>

      <p>- He requested that the Commission Secretary write a letter commending the staff who worked on this plan and that a copy of this letter be placed in their personnel files.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Article in Sunday's Chronicle (5/8/05) titled:  The Ephemeral City, San Francisco has lost its middle class, become a 'theme park for restaurants,' and is the playground of the nomadic rich and restless leeches living off them by Joel Kotkin</i></p>

      <p>- This article brings up interesting points.</p>

      <p>- Most of the City will be developed in the next few years.  Is this what the City will look like in the year 2020?</p>

      <p>- Is the City going to rely on tourism only?  Is the middle class going to be lost? Is the City taking the right approach in doing planning for the next two or three years?</p>

      <p>- He requested that the Planning Department provide some guidance.  Perhaps the person who wrote this article can come to the Planning Commission and provide a question and answer session.</p>

          <ul><ul><p><b>Interim Director Macris responded:</b></p>

          <p>- He read the article also.</p>

          <p>- John King wrote a response to Mr. Kotin's article.</p>

          <p>- When one generalizes as Mr. Kotkin did, there is only a grain of truth.</p>

          <p>- Various speakers could be invited.  Although some might request a fee but something can be arranged.</p>

      </ul></ul><p><b>Commission Antonini:</b></p>

      <p>- He would like the department to proceed [with setting something up.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner S. Lee:</b></p>

      <p>- She feels that it is a worthy topic to discuss.  Maybe a larger forum should be planned.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Hughes:</b></p>

      <p>- This project was denied by the Commission on April 21, 2005.  It was denied because an elevator was non compliant with the permit.</p>

      <p>- The Commission requested additional information from the counsel for the project sponsor.</p>

      <p>- Since that time, they did put in a submittal and in review of that submittal, there is one item of particular merit to warrant the rehearing. </p>

      <p>- What was in noncompliance was the elevator and the location of the elevator.  Now there is a jurisdictional issue as it relates to compliance with state regulations. </p>

      <p>- They need more space and he and others in the department are working on a plan to more the department into a single place instead of two (1660 Mission Street and 30 Van Ness).</p>

      <p>- They are exploring the building immediately next door (1650 Mission Street).  This way, DBI can use the entire building at 1660 Mission Street.</p>

      <p>- He along with Alicia Jean-Baptiste and representatives from Park and Rec, Controllers and City Attorney's Office attended this meeting regarding the open space fund that was generated by 447 Battery Street.</p>

      <p>- The Commission directed him to grant a Variance in affect that would allow payment to a non-profit group.  The money was not spent as it should have been.</p>

      <p>- Of the $275,000, the City has received $162,000.  Park and Rec has received this money.  Staff is asking to account for $35,000 in administrative funds and about $40,000 that is short.</p>

      <p>- Director Macris wrote a few letters asking for more information on the status of this $40,000.</p>

      <p>- The CEDG responded that they did not have the money and were seeking it from the former Board.</p>

      <p>- Staff will be meeting with the City Attorney and the Controller to determine what the next steps will be.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Medical Canabus Dispensary Moratorium</i></p>

      <p>- The Mayor signed this into law in April--a 45 day moratorium which will expire next week.</p>

      <p>- Supervisor Mirkarimi is asking for an extension.</p>

      <p>- This legislation will come to the Planning Commission in the near future.</p>

      <p>- Planning staff recommended a 6-month moratorium.</p>

      <p>- The Board overturned the Commission +5-0 with the explanation that family housing is important and that the tenant had moved out voluntarily.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  2169 Folsom Street</i></p>

      <p>- The Commission did not hear this case but he thought it important to mention.</p>

      <p>- There was one live work unit that wanted to expand.  He determined that live work cannot be expanded because they are non-conforming uses.  The Board overturned the denial of the building permit based upon his interpretation of the law because the space that was being used could be used as an artist studio or a gallery and not an expansion of the live work.</p>

      <p>- He will take a closer look at the ordinance.</p>

      <p><i>Re: 1921 Palou Avenue</i></p>

      <p>- This project was before the Commission.  It was determined to expand a lightwell and the project was approved.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Public Comment from April 28, 2005</i></p>

      <p>- Ms. Sue Hestor spoke about case reports not being submitted to the Board of Appeals.</p>

      <p>- He spoke to members of the Board and it is true that the information was not being submitted to the Board of Appeals.</p>

      <p>- He has submitted a draft proposal to make sure that the procedure is working and that case material is being submitted to the Board of Appeals.</p>

      <p>- It was suggested that when a motion is made, there should also be a summary of why the Commission took this action.  In other words, the Commission should state the reason why they are taking their action.  This would assist the case planner in defending the Commission's decision.</p>

      <p><b>Commissioner Hughes:</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Board of Appeals</i></p>

      <p>- When the Commission receives information from staff and from the public and they develop policy, is the basis of an appeal to the Board of Appeals limited to an appeal based on procedure, based on misapplication of the policy or does the Board have broad discretion in that they simply in their opinion don't believe that the policy has merit and consequently can uphold an appeal and eliminate the existence of a policy?</p>

          <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

          <p>- The Board of Appeals is not governed by the Commission's decision and can take into account the policy of the Commission but it is not their policy.</p>

      </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Hughes:</b></p>

          <p>- Even if the Board had the same amount of input, they can come to a different conclusion.</p>

      <p>- If the Commission feels strongly about this then it should be codified so that it binds the Board of Appeals.</p>

The proposal is to change a Type 41 ABC license (beer and wine; food service required) to a Type 42 ABC license (beer and wine; food service not required).  Under Article 7 of the Planning Code, this proposal constitutes a change of use from a restaurant to a bar.  There will be no physical expansion of the existing building or commercial space.

      <p><b>(+) Mike Giggles - Project Sponsor</b></p>

      <p>- He previously applied for an entertainment license.</p>

      <p>- He has a small caf&eacute; legally classified as a small service restaurant.</p>

      <p>- The caf&eacute; does not have a license for spirits.</p>

      <p>- ABC has received a number of complaints.</p>

      <p>- His business is small so even a small fine hurts.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Courtney Clarkson</b></p>

      <p>- She owns a small business near this project.</p>

      <p>- She has spent a few years renovating the building.</p>

      <p>- Almost every time she goes to the building she notices that there is a large amount of liquor containers near the building.</p>

      <p>- Many times she has had to close the gate of her building because when people are intoxicated, they urinate in the area.</p>

      <p>- The neighborhood is full of bars and there is no need for another one.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Brad Wilmore - Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association</b></p>

      <p>- It is very difficult when there is a retail operation near a bar.  During the day everything is quiet and clean, but in the evenings, there is much trash and disturbance.</p>

      <p>- THD is in favor of small businesses but the heavy bar traffic is a detriment to the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- They are in support of neighborhood servicing businesses.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Gerry Crowley - Telegraph Hill Dwellers</b></p>

      <p>- The owner originally wanted a full liquor license.</p>

      <p>- This project is destined to be a night bar.</p>

      <p>- She hopes that the project sponsor will [does not] return to his original plan.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Michael Goebel</b></p>

      <p>- He currently works at the restaurant.</p>

      <p>- There is a misconception that they are not going to act as a restaurant.</p>

      <p>- Their intention to switch to a liquor license, is because they still want to serve food but also liquor.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Approval </p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><b>(+) Supervisor Aaron Peskin - Sponsor of Legislation</b></p>

      <p>- Washington Street has historically been the dividing line between the bulk and mass of downtown and the human scale of neighborhood environment of Jackson Square and Telegraph Hill.</p>

      <p>- These are zoning battles that took place in the late 1960's. </p>

      <p>- In the late 1980's there was an up zoning that happened and nobody, not even people with the wisdom of Mr. Badiner, quite remember what happened, but that created the 65 D-200 which allows buildings up to 200 feet on the north side of Washington Street. </p>

      <p>- The legislation here before the Commission is designed simply to maintain the human scale environment north of Washington Street in accordance with the built environment that exists there. </p>

      <p>- Mr. Lord indicated that City College has indeed submitted a letter that indicates that they support the legislation and further warns that as a state institution, it is not binding upon them and any properties that they own. </p>

      <p>- He is available for questions and hopes that the Commission will recommend it to the Board of Supervisors. </p>

      <p><b>(-) Ron Lee - Chinatown Neighbors Association</b></p>

      <p>- The height modification is not good for the neighborhood because it would discourage development.</p>

      <p>- Development to improve old buildings and empty lots would increase revenue.</p>

      <p>- This height limit would decrease property values.</p>

      <p>- The existing height laws are already in place and are fair.</p>

      <p>- He is opposed to the height modifications.</p>

      <p>- It is not fair to take away their development rights.</p>

      <p><b>(+) Debra Stein</b></p>

      <p>- There are a lot of issues that have been resolved in the last four years.</p>

      <p>- Sutro Tower is a shared facility.</p>

      <p>- The existing operations are not before the Commission today.</p>

      <p>- This project complies with all standards.</p>

      <p>- The alterations before the Commission today are minor.</p>

      <p>- The antenna will not transmit harmful radiation.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Eileen Bocken</b></p>

      <p>- There are a number of diesel storage facilities at Sutro Tower already.</p>

      <p>- There are about 200 antennae already at this location.</p>

      <p>- It is not sound policy to have such a high concentration of the City's Telecommunications structures in one location.</p>

      <p>- She recommends that this proposal be turned down.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Christine Linenbach - Twin Peaks Improvement Association</b></p>

      <p>- She requested that the City Attorney explain the scope of the appeal that was taken to the California State Court of Appeals.  </p>

      <p>- The use permit clearly states that Sutro Tower is limited to one tower and one building. Currently the proposal is for two 15-foot diameter satellite dishes on top of a garage that was never part of the Conditional Use permit.  And this garage has never received authorization from the Zoning Administrator as being part of the Conditional Use.</p>

      <p>- There are several questions of safety.  For example, why does the fuel tank have to be installed closest to residential homes and water supplies?  Why do the satellite dishes have to be <i>on top</i> of the garage?</p>

      <p>- She requested that this hearing be continued so that this case can be heard before the Board of Appeals first and then before the Planning Commission.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Everett Homebolt</b></p>

      <p>- He is opposed to this proposal because he is concerned about the diesel facility.</p>

      <p>- He believes that this will be a fire hazard.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned about the flammable liquids.</p>

      <p>- The affects of long-term exposure have not been fully explored.</p>

      <p>- The seismic danger has not been completely discussed either.</p>

      <p><b>(-) Walter Kaplan - Forest Knowles Association</b></p>

      <p>- There was improper notice of this hearing.</p>

      <p>- The project description is inaccurate and incomplete, thereby depriving interested parties of proper and adequate notice of the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- A CU authorization is required by this project.</p>

      <p>- Staff states that this project is exempted from environmental review.</p>

      </blockquote></blockquote></blockquote><ul><ul><ul><p><b>Eileen Boken - SPEAK</b></p>

      <p><i>Re:  1234 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue</i></p>

      <p>- This proposed demolition of a pre-1906 Victorian came before the Commission previously.</p>

      <p>- The Commission rejected the proposed demolition and SPEAK was the main opponent to this demolition. </p>

      <p>- Just last week this appeal came before the Board of Appeals and the Commission's determination was overturned. </p>

      <p>- SPEAK was not at this hearing to state the case against demolition. </p>

      <p>- When trying to figure out what went so terribly wrong, she spoke with the legal assistant of the Board of Appeals.</p>

      <p>- The first thing mentioned to her was that the Board of Appeals did not receive a copy of the project file from the Planning Department. </p>

      <p>- The Board of Appeals did not see the same information that the Commission did when the Commission made its determination. </p>

      <p>- The board based its decision primarily on information provided by the project sponsor. </p>

      <p>- Also, because the Board of Appeals did not receive the project file, they also did not receive a list of interested parties so notification was only sent to immediate neighbors. </p>

      <p>- SPEAK did not receive notification even though it was the primary opponent to the proposed demolition. </p>

      <p>- The findings of the appeal will be heard on May 18, 2005.</p>

      <p>- she requested that the Commission instruct the Zoning Administrator to issue a formal request for a rehearing before May 18.</p>

      <p>- Also, she requested that the Commission instruct the Planning Department to forward a copy of the project file to the Board of Appeals. </p>
