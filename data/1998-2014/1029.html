<p><font class="heading2">A. CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>The Commission will consider a request for continuance to a later date.  The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.</p>

      <ul><p>1. 2002.0277C (A. LIGHT:  (415) 558-6254)</p>

      <p><u>150 GOLDEN GATE AVENUE</u> - north side between Jones and Leavenworth Streets, in Assessor's Block 344, Lot 4.  Request for a Conditional Use authorization to construct a building exceeding 40 feet in height in an R (Residential) District, to determine an appropriate setback at the top portion of the front of the fa&ccedil;ade of the proposed building, and to allow an Institutional Use in an RC (Residential Commercial Combined) District.  The subject property is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial, Combined, High Density) District, is in the North of Market Special Use District, and is in an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.   The proposal is to demolish an existing four-story, approximately 88-foot high vacant building originally used as a lodge building for the Knights of Columbus, and most recently as office space.  The existing building would be replaced with a new five-story, approximately 78'-0&quot; high building that would house administrative and some on-site service functions of the St. Anthony Foundation which provides a variety of services to homeless and other disadvantaged individuals.  The proposed facility at 150 Golden Gate would function as part of a larger campus of St. Anthony's and would specifically provide space for administrative offices, counseling, health and job training services, and, temporarily, some dining services, until a new dining and residential structure could be constructed across the street.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with Conditions</p>

      <p>(Continued from Regular Meeting of April 10, 2003)</p>

        meetings but there is still information we need.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">John Nulty - PILE</font></p>
      <p>- The proposed building has a historical rating and it would lose its

      <p>- The project is not ready to move forward. Please allow the continuance.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Elaine Zamora</font></p>

        meetings. This project is definitely moving forward but there is still 
        a lot to be done.</p>

      <p>- He is in agreement with the continuance.</p>

      <ul><ul><ul><p>6. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

      <p>- Last Monday night, Commissioners Sue Lee, Bill Lee, Amit Ghosh and he took part in a panel at St. John's Presbyterian Church.  It was very well attended and there was a lot of interest from the neighborhood in having similar type events in various neighborhoods.  He welcomes these events as an on going process on the Housing Element.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

      <p>- She attended the Land Use Committee meeting with Director Green.  She would like to have scheduled a review of the Planning Department's work plan.  It is important for the Commission as well as staff to provide their input.</p>

</ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

      <ul><ul><ul><p>7. Director's Announcements</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Results of the Budget Process</i></p>

      <p>- The Board included in it's budget the recommendations given by the Budget Analyst.</p>

      <p>- A Planner V position was lost so personnel actions will have to be done.</p>

      <p>- The department is still going through the process of trying to find a way to get the work done given the budget decisions that were made.</p>

      <p>8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">BOS - </font></p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Land Use Committee meeting of July 24, 2003:</font></p>

      <p>- Supervisor McGoldrick held a hearing to review the Planning Department's work plan for this new 2003/2004 fiscal year. It was Supervisor McGoldrick's intention &quot;to assist the Full Board in establishing priorities for the Department as they adopt our Budget.&quot;  Planning Staff present at the hearing included Director Green; Zoning Administrator Larry Badiner; and Amit Ghosh, Chief of Citywide Policy Planning to respond to questions about the priorities that the department has assigned to the various planning initiatives and projects currently undergoing review.    Staff was joined by President Bradford-Bell who made a strong case for a collaborative effort between the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors in setting the priorities for the Department. The hearing was continued at the call of the chair, and there was discussion about the possibility of a joint hearing between the Board's Land Use Committee and the Planning Commission about reviewing and setting the priorities for the Planning Department.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Coffee Stores and Drug stores</i></p>

      <p>The committee also voted out to the Full Board for action on a unanimous vote Supervisor Gonzalez's legislation providing neighborhood noticing for new Retail Coffee Stores and drugstores in Neighborhood Commercial Districts.   This had been recommended unanimously by this Commission on June 5.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Full Board of Supervisors Meeting of July 15:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Secondary Units</i></p>

      <p>The Full Board of Supervisors held a hearing on the appeal of the Department's determination that the Secondary Unit legislation is exempt from further environmental review. Single family homes are statutorily exempt from CEQA review according to a new state law.  As far as multiple unit buildings are concerned, the department found the potential impact of the legislation on that type of housing stock to be minimal, so staff issued a General Rule Exemption from environmental review for that part of the legislation.  The majority of the Board of Supervisors agreed with staff's determination and upheld the exemption on a 6-5 vote. (voting to uphold: Ammiano, Daly, Dufty, Gonzalez, Maxwell and Peskin.) Voting for the appeal: Hall, Ma, McGoldrick, Newsom and Sandoval).   The legislation will be considered by the Commission on August 21, 2003.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  270 - 284 Valencia Street CU Appeal</i></p>

      <p>The Board heard the appeal of the CU authorization of the 28-unit residential project at 270-284 Valencia Street. This project had been approved unanimously by this Commission and had received extensive neighborhood support.  The project sponsor, Mr. Spears had voluntarily provided all 2-bedroom units as affordable units to respond the community's desires for affordable family housing.  This was appealed by a next door neighbor to the Board with the signatures of 5 supervisors. After a failed attempt to amend the project, the Board voted unanimously to uphold your CU authorization.</p>

      <p><u>Re:  Jackson Square SUD</u></p>

      <p>To basically protect specialty retail and antique stores from conversion to other uses by subjecting applicants to a CU at the ground floor level. Passed unanimously by the Board.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Full Board of Supervisor's Meeting of July 22</font></p>

(Approved +4 -3: Antonini, Boyd, Hughes, and Sue Lee voted for and: Bell, Feldstein, and Bill Lee voted against) on May 1.</p>

      <p><u>3537 19TH ST (19<sup>th</sup> Street PG&amp;E transformer).</u> Appeal of the CU to authorize six antennas and backup equipment located on the building's rooftop for AT&amp;T wireless. Appealed by neighborhood signatures.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Reed Bement - Rincon Hill Resident Association</font></p>

      <p>- He has lived in the area for over 10 years.</p>

      <p>- He is here to ask the Commission to instruct staff to keep to their word.</p>

      <p>- Comprehensive planning for the overall area is what is most important.</p>

      <p>- That means planning for the whole neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- This presentation is the first time that it has been presented to the Commission and to the public.</p>

      <p>- Public input is very important in order to find out what the residents really need and want.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Ted Chiao</font></p>

      <p>- He is a resident of this neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The Planning Commission/Department does seem to have a plan.</p>

      <p>- There are still details that he has concerns about: height/separation, rezoning, etc.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Terry Carlitz</font></p>

      <p>- She is a homeowner in the Rincon Hill area.</p>

      <p>- She would like to propose that until the department has had the proper input from the public, it would be wrong minded to approve any project that comes before the Commission in the near future.</p>

      <p>- It is important to develop properly the next most desirable neighborhood.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Tim Tosta - Steffel, Levitt and Weiss</font></p>

      <p>- When there is a zoning process, there is a degree of difficulty to plan it out.</p>

      <p>- It is hard to keep the original idea and the original enthusiasm as a project or a planning process continues.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Howard Meadow - Rincon Hill Residents Association</font></p>

      <p>- He has been a resident of Rincon Hill for about six years.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Ernestine Weiss</font></p>

      <p>- She would not like &quot;leap frog&quot; meetings in the neighborhood.  It is important to have all the meetings involve the public.</p>

      <p>- There is a need for sufficient open space in the area.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Howard Strassner - Sierra Club</font></p>

      <p>- It is important to cut down the number of cars.  There are many parking structures that are two levels.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Jim Chappell - President SPUR</font></p>

      <p>- He has been working on all the plans included in the presentation.</p>

      <p>- There has been a tremendous amount of public input.</p>

      <p>- He congratulated the Planning Department for this very informative and thorough presentation.</p>

      <p>- The supply of housing must be increased.</p>

      <p>- He asked the Commission to provide their help to get these plans moving along.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Theodore Brown</font></p>

      <p>- He lives in Rincon Hill.</p>

      <p>- There has been a lot of tough work done on this plan.</p>

      <p>- He displayed maps of the Rincon Hill area and how the presentation given by staff would apply to the project he currently has in the area.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Bob Meyers - Architect and City Planning Consultant</font></p>

      <p>- He serves on the Tranbay Citizen's Advisory Committee</p>

      <p>- Any zoning is challenging and takes time.</p>

      <p>- He displayed maps of the Rincon Hill area.</p>

      <p>- Having open space is great but there are too many homeless people and crime activity.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Jill Howard - Realtor</font></p>

      <p>- She asked the Commission to really consider the height limitation.</p>

      <p>- She feels very strongly that there is a need for housing.</p>

      <p>- Although there are many projects being proposed now, there are not that many units for families.  Housing for families is very important.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Alice Chung</font></p>

      <p>- She is a resident of Rincon Hill.</p>

      <p>- She encourages the Planning Commission to support staff's presentation.</p>

      <p>- There are discrepancies between the Planning Department and the Redevelopment Agency.</p>

      <p>- She also encouraged the Commission not to approve spot rezoning.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Bobby Carter</font></p>

      <p>- It seems that there is a tunnel situation here.</p>

      <p>- She tried to get data and could not find out what was being proposed for the area.</p>

      <p>- It would be short sighted to move forward.</p>

      <p>- She was amazed to see the areas of traffic, wind, light and the impact that there will be with raising the height on buildings.</p>

      <p>- The data is somewhat incomplete and needs to be researched further.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

      <p>- She did not hear any information from staff on their June 19, 2003 recommendation.</p>

      <p>- There seems to be some contradictions from staff.</p>

      <p>- There is a staff recommendation to increase staff and building separation, etc. yet there is no EIR for all this.</p>

      <p>- There is a lot at stake in this area.</p>

      <p>- She recommended that staff not talk about blocks, but instead talk about feet.</p>

      <p>ACTION:  Informational only.  No action required.</p>

    <p>- The underground garage will filter fumes.</p>
    <p>- She urges the Commission to support the project.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Mary Ann Miller - San Francisco Tomorrow</font></p>

    <p>- There were Phases I and II, so it is difficult to certify an EIR when

      because there should be further study done.</p>
    <p>- There is going to be new improvements everywhere.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Chris Duderstadt - San Francisco Tomorrow</font></p>
    <p>- Does this EIR accurately recognize the environmental impacts and then 
      provide solutions?</p>
    <p>- Architectural Heritage, Landmark Board, etc. have concerns that further 
      studies should be done.</p>
    <p>- The garage has not defined how the tunnels will be replaced.</p>

    <p>- Since the authority was formed there has been extensive community involvement.</p>
    <p>- They have worked hard to design a garage that would have the least impact 
      to the park.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Alyce Brown - FDR Demo Club</font></p>
    <p>- The garage will provide an easier access to the park and will have very 
      little impact on the park.</p>
    <p>- She is always against demolishing historic sites.</p>
    <p>- She encourages the Commission to certify the EIR.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Sandra Treacy - North Park Neighbors Association</font></p>
    <p>- This garage is very important to the park.</p>
    <p>- The neighborhood association has read the comments and responses very 
      closely.</p>
    <p>- The responses indicate that there will not be any negative impact to 
      the neighborhood. She certainly hopes that this would be the case.</p>

    <p>- She supports the improvements planned in Golden Gate Park.</p>
    <p>- She believes that the EIR does not adequately address the impacts on 
      the neighborhood.</p>

      the neighborhood wanting to park for free.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Howard Strassner - Sierra Club</font></p>
    <p>- The Sierra Club did not take a stand on Prop J. Since it was passed, 
      they have been working very hard on a pedestrian OASIS.</p>
    <p>- He urges the Commission not to certify the EIR.</p>
    <p>- There should be a monitor to catch the impacts on 9<sup>th</sup> Avenue.</p>
    <p>- The pedestrian OASIS is not shown in the EIR. It is important to deal

    <p>- She lives in the Richmond District.</p>
    <p>- There are still concerns for the residents on the Richmond side.</p>
    <p>- She endorses and supports the comments of the North Park Neighbors.</p>
    <p>- Although the EIR states that there will not be negative impacts to the

    <p>- She urges the Commission to certify the EIR with a condition that parking 
      impacts will be minimized.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Wunderman - San Francisco Chamber of Commerce</font></p>

      is very thorough. He urges the Commission to certify the EIR.</p>

      issue.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Katherine Howard - American Society of Landscape Architects</font></p>
    <p>- The trees were planted in 1902 when the band shell was opened.</p>
    <p>- The leaves on the trees are important to provide shade.</p>
    <p>- Removal of the trees would leave a hole in the canopy.</p>
    <p>- If the trees are removed, instead of having a pleasant environment there 
      would only be a &quot;dust bowl.&quot;</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Carolyn Blair - San Francisco Tree Council, Member of Urban Forest</font></p>
    <p>- She asks the Commission to reject the EIR because there is not enough 
      information on traffic impacts, etc.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Joan Downey - CVIA and Rescue MUNI</font></p>
    <p>- The park shuttle is the key to the transit plan.</p>
    <p>- There is not enough ridership to fund the shuttle.</p>
    <p>- There is not enough information regarding the &quot;G&quot; line of MUNI.</p>
    <p>- There is not enough information on how there will be a linkage with current 
      MUNI lines.</p>
    <p>- She urges the Commission to reject this EIR.</p>

    <p>- He is extremely concerned because he feels it is totally fraudulent.</p>
    <p>- There will be a negative impact on the traffic.</p>
    <p>- There is not enough information regarding private and public money.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Harry Parker - Director of the Fine Arts Museums</font></p>
    <p>- This has been a very long process. It has been the subject of public 
      discussion for about 15 years.</p>
    <p>- They are committed with working with the neighborhood. He realizes that 
      there will be disruption, but they will be working hard to mitigate it.</p>
    <p>- He urges the Commission to certify this EIR.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Michael Burke - Music Concourse Community</font></p>
    <p>- The Responses and Comments document has about 800 pages and is the largest 
      he has ever seen. All of these responses and comments have been dealt with.</p>
    <p>- The project description has not changed at all.</p>
    <p>- The pedestrian tunnels and their significance have been address in this 
      document.</p>
    <p>- The circulation pattern was a concern by the Landmarks Advisory Board 
      and not necessarily the tunnel.</p>
    <p>- There will be tremendous opportunity for the public to comment on the 
      design.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Gloria Tulanowski</font></p>
    <p>- She has lived in the City for many years.</p>
    <p>- Parking has always been a problem.</p>
    <p>- This project is encouraging automobiles.</p>
    <p>- She has met a lot of people from various places and means that take MUNI.</p>
    <p>- A 10,000-car garage is not important.</p>

      <p><u>GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS</u> - <font class="heading2">Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)</font> - The site is between the California Academy of Sciences and the M.H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1.</p>

      <p>Since publication of the Draft EIR, the Executive Director of the Project Sponsor, Concourse Authority, notified the Planning Department that the preferred project as analyzed in the DEIR has been revised.  The project, as revised, consists of Phase I, the Underground Parking Facility, and the Transportation Improvement Measures (&quot;TIP&quot;), both as analyzed as part of the preferred project in the DEIR.  Phase II, the Underground Through Street, has been severed from the project and removed from further consideration.  As a consequence, the preferred project, as revised, is Phase I and the TIP elements only.  This project was identified in the DEIR as Alternative B.  With the severance of Phase II, the project, as revised, has no physical environmental impact on the historic character of the Rhododendron Dell, an area of Golden Gate Park considered individually eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources.  As a result, the project, as revised, has eliminated the significant unavoidable impact to this resource that was identified in the DEIR.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note the public review period for the DEIR ended at 5:00 pm, February 5, 2003. <font class="heading2">Public hearing has been closed.</font></p>

      <p>- He is available for questions.</p>

      <p>- He displayed the site plans and some of the justification materials.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Megan Sullivan</font></p>

      <p>- This is an undesirable and unnecessary antenna installation.</p>

      <p>- The Richmond District residents are opposed to this installation.</p>

      <p>- AT&amp;T Wireless fails to prove necessity for these antennas.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Betty Chiao</font></p>

      <p>- She has lived on 11<sup>th</sup> Avenue for 13 years.</p>

      <p>- She lives one block from the project site and is opposed to the installation of the antennas because of health concerns.</p>

      <p>- There are schools, libraries and churches near the proposed site.  This could be dangerous to the residents.</p>

      <p>- She used to be an AT&amp;T client and never had any problems with her cell phone so additional antennas are not needed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gloria Tulenowskly</font></p>

      <p>- She is opposed to this project because there are just too many cell phones.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Chuck Chan</font></p>

      <p>- It was anticipated that by June 30, 1998 a telecommunications facility master plan would be implemented into the communities facilities element of the City's General Plan.  It is five years overdue.</p>

      <p>- The Planning Department is allowing antennas in buildings that do not meet the FCC.</p>

      <p>- The Planning Department does not do the thorough research needed to measure RF emissions and does not consider the usage of multiple fix transmitters that could exceed RF limits.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ken Chan</font></p>

      <p>- On July 10, 2003 there were many people attending a Planning Commission hearing and the hearing was cancelled at the last minute.</p>

      <p>- They have obtained thousands of signatures of people who are against AT&amp;T installing antennas in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The supply of antennas is sufficient.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Benny Lew</font></p>

      <p>- The reason he opposes this antenna is that there are over 2,600 signatures of people who oppose this project.</p>

      <p>- AT&amp;T chose summertime for this hearing and many people in the neighborhood have gone on vacation so they are not aware of this project.</p>

      <p>- This project is fully code compliant, there will be no significant increase in building size, quality architecture will be used, and the project is popular with neighbors.  All the neighbors are happy that the current house will be demolished.</p>

      <p>- This property is not legally two units.</p>

      <p>- This is an ideal project for replacement.</p>

      <p>- In 99 years a total of four permits were issued.  Three of those permits were for cosmetic work, and the other for plumbing work.</p>

      <p>- There is a notice of violation stating that this building is structurally unsafe.</p>

      <p>- The cost analysis and the repair cost analysis prove this violation.</p>

      <p>- The building has been vacant because of its poor condition.</p>

      <p>- This building is not habitable and is over 100 years old.</p>

      </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor - Representing Discretionary Review Applicant</font></p>

      <p>- This project is across the rear of St. Luke's Hospital.</p>

      <p>- The neighborhood is a working class neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The project will dislocate the tenant until the completion of the project.</p>

      <p>-  There is not a very well thought out solution since the project will be jacked up.</p>

      <p>- There is a waste of low-income housing.</p>

      <p>- The tenant already pays about 80% of his salary to rent.</p>

      <p>- She is asking to not allow this much demolition of the interior, and require a rational alteration to allow the tenant to stay in place. The tenant will not be able to come back because the rent will be much, much higher.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jose Morales</font></p>

      <p>- He has been living in the property since 1982.</p>

      <p>- Because of rent control he has been able to live there affordably with his family.</p>

      <p>- He is a senior citizen and with both his Social Security check and income as a tennis instructor, he is able to pay his rent.</p>

      <p>- He is asking the Commission to have consideration of his situation.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Lora Traveler - Park Merced Presidents Organization</font></p>

      <p>- The issue here is fairness.  She is deeply concerned that if this project is approved it will result in both displacement and an affordable rent unit being eliminated.</p>

      <p>- This will cause economical and emotional distress.</p>

      <p>- The Discretionary Review requestor's situation does not permit him to move to another location or pay higher rent.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Chester Zemany - SF Tenants Union</font></p>

      <p>- He has known the tenant for many years.</p>

      <p>- It is a terrible thing to displace an elderly person.</p>

      <p>- After being involved in this case, he believes that the real reason for this is to increase the rent of a rent controlled unit.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Steven Shubert</font></p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to deny the permit.</p>

      <p>- This is a displacement of a senior citizen on an extremely limited income who has been active in the community as well as a valued neighbor.</p>

      <p>- Homelessness is a real concern right now.</p>

      <p>- There are ways that this project could be done.</p>

      <p>- Ms. Hestor has come up with real alternatives.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sam Dodge</font></p>

      <p>- He has known Mr. Morales for many years.</p>

      <p>- It breaks his hear to force this person out of the community.</p>

      <p>- This building is very historically significant so there are ways to preserve the building.</p>

      <p>- Mr. Morales was involved in fighting for the rights of a senior citizen in a similar situation in the Western Addition so it is ironic that he is here fighting for Mr. Morales now.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ted Gullicksen - San Francisco Tenants Union</font></p>

      <p>- This is a loss for diversity, and senior citizens are very vulnerable.</p>

      <p>- A senior citizen will lose his home.</p>

      <p>- Many tenants do not return after such evictions.</p>

      <p>- Granting this approval will be the decision to evict Mr. Morales.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bob Coleman - Golden Gateway Tenants Association</font></p>

      <p>- This case caught his attention because of the great contributions of Mr. Morales.</p>

      <p>- He is proud with what Ms. Hestor has done on the case.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Leon Low</font></p>

      <p>- He is here to speak on behalf of Mr. Morales.</p>

      <p>- The point here is that Mr. Morales is close to the edge.  It is just about dollars and cents.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Ara Tehlirian - Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- He purchased this property a few years ago but was not living there.  He now wants to move back to San Francisco and live in this property with his wife and child.</p>

      <p>- Mr. Morales has the right to claim financial hardship.</p>

      <p>- He is willing to do everything that is required of him as a landlord.</p>

      <p>- Everyone who has spoken and are in support of taking Discretionary Review do not live in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to not delay this project further.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Charles Ng - Project Designer/Contractor - Best Design Construction</font></p>

      <p>- The project sponsor has no intention of evicting Mr. Morales.</p>

      <p>- This project is an alteration and not a demolition.</p>

      <p>- The project will provide better conditions for the tenants and will provide parking.</p>

      <p>- The building has a brick foundation so there is a lot of structural work that needs to be done.</p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to approve the project as proposed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Miguel Williams</font></p>

      <p>- The reason he opposes this project is the issue of affordable housing.</p>

      <p>- There is nothing enforceable to evict the tenant.</p>

      <p>- There will be a curb cut, which will make it not pedestrian friendly.</p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to oppose this project.</p>

      <p>- The public benefits of this project are:  1) the building will remain as a two-unit building; 2) the reconfigured replacement unit will likely be more affordable than the existing units; 3) The original historic interior will be preserved and restored; 4) the building will be returned to its original single-family configuration; 5) the exterior front fa&ccedil;ade will be restored to reflect its original Victorian architectural style and integrity--in keeping with neighborhood character; 6) The building will undergo seismic upgrade and updating of plumbing, electrical and heating systems; 7) approximately 1,000 square feet of new residential space will be created, consequently expanding San Francisco's housing resources.</p>
