SIDER: (415) 558-6697)<br>296 TOWNSEND STREET, a landlocked lot between 4th, Brannan, Townsend, and Lusk Streets; Lot 163 in Assessor's Block 3787: Request for Conditional Use Authorization pursuant to Planning Code Sections 818.14 and 102.7 to allow the establishment of a dwelling unit within an SSO (Secondary Service / Office) Mixed-Use Zoning District. The proposal is to convert an existing 3-level live/work unit into a dwelling unit so that (1) the existing 3rd story could be expanded to accommodate 520 additional square feet of floor area and (2) 170 square feet of floor area could be added within the existing 2nd level . The work would include raising the overall height of the building by up to 7 feet. Planning Code Sections 233 and 181 prohibit the expansion or intensification of live/work units. A Rear Yard Modification, pursuant to Planning Code Section 134(e), is also requested as part of this project. The subject property is within an SSO Mixed-Use Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proposed for Continuance to February 6, 2003)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to February 6, 2003<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.

The proposal is to convert and existing live/work unit into a dwelling unit and to perform interior and exterior alterations. Without such modification, Planning Code Sections 134(a)(1) and 134(a)(1)(C) would require that 25 percent of the total lot depth be provided at the lowest story containing a dwelling unit and at each succeeding level. As measured from 4th Street, the total depth of the subject lot is 136 feet; a 34 foot required rear yard is therefore required for the proposed dwelling unit. At all levels of the proposed dwelling, the rearmost 31 feet of the lot are occupied by a 3-story live/work unit. A rear yard is not required for live/work units. The subject property is within an SSO Mixed-Use Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation: Approval with conditions.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Proposed for Continuance to February 6, 2003)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to February 6, 2003<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antonini, Bradford Bell, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.

She requested that anything sent directly to commissioners be forwarded or copied to the Commission Secretary for inclusion in the public file.<br>Commissioner Antonini:<br>- He thought that the hearing last week went very well but wanted to clarify a couple of things:<br>1) Some people filled out more than one speaker card.  This caused delays and confusion.<br>2) People are allowed to have an interpreter.  If a person elected to use the interpreter they were given twice as much time to speak than those who did not use the interpreter.<br><br>Commissioner Hughes:<br>- He has a question on information he receives:  If he receives something from the public should he send a copy or the original?

We are attempting to reserve the Board of Supervisor's Chambers for that date with a starting time around 5:00 p.m. or 6:00 p.m.<br>- February 20, 2003 is not a suitable hearing date for this item because he would like to have this date also reserved to complete the Commission hearing and action process on the Department's budget&ndash;as well as their hearing agenda.<br>- February 27, 2003 is a date that is already impacted with regular hearing items.<br><br>Re:  Antenna Guidelines<br>- He would recommend taking some time on February 20 to address this item.<br>- This would give us enough time to get a representative from the Health Department and have all the different carriers present.<br><br>Re: Grant<br>- The department will be a beneficiary of a grant.<br>- A copy of this contract has been placed in Commissioner's folders.<br>- If the Commission has no issues on this contract, he will move forward on it.<br><br>Re: Day Labor Project<br>- He passed forward the conditions that were placed on the approval of this project.

H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1.
