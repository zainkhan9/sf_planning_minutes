    <p><strong>Revised 4th paragraph:</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>The Commission has heard and considered testimony and written materials and
    oral testimony presented to it at the public hearing on behalf of the applicant,
    Department staff, and other interested parties.</strong> </p>
    <p><u><strong>Findings:</strong></u> </p>
    <p><strong>4. During the hearing before the Commission<strike> The Department has received
    conflicting testimony regarding the date that the unit in question was established.
    According to documents from the Department of Building Inspections, the unit was
    established prior to 1960. A previous tenant and a current tenant in the building have
    testified that the unit existed prior to the purchase of the building by the applicant.
    However,</strike> several tenants of the building <strike>have</strike> testified that the
    unit was established within the past two years. No evidence was submitted during the
    hearing to establish that the unit had existed prior to 1960.</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>6. <strike>Although the Commission received some testimony from neighborhood
    residents that the additional unit would not be detrimental</strike> Strong opposition to
    the unit was received from a number of occupants of the building and from several
    residents in the neighborhood.</strong> </p>
    <p><strike><strong>7. The project complies with all applicable provisions of the Planning
    Code.</strong></strike> </p>
    <p><strong>7<strike> 8. </strike>The Residence Element of the General Plan (Objective 3,
    Policy 3) encourages legalizing illegal dwelling units, but only when there is no
    neighborhood opposition.</strong> </p>
    <p><strong>8. The evidence before Commission established <strike>believes</strike> that
    the current owner established the unit in question without the benefit of a Building
    Permit. <strike>In order to avoid setting a precedent of encourage the construction of
    illegal units, the Commission feels an obligation to deny the Conditional Use
    Authorization.</strike></strong> </p>

<p>		<u>249 SHIPLEY STREET</u>, 12 Live/Work Units: Appeal of Preliminary Negative
Declaration.  The proposal is to construct 12 live/work units in one building at
249 Shipley Street (Assessor's  3753, Lot 66), on the south side of the street
between 5th and 6th Streets.  The project site is currently used for vehicle
parking and a one-story taxi maintenance building and three service bays on the
southwest corner.  The existing 13,625 square-foot lot would be subdivided into
two lots, one facing Shipley Street (approximately 5,625 square feet), and the
other fronting Clara Street (8,000 square feet). A new 45-foot structure would be
built on the new Shipley lot, and would contain three stories including two
mezzanine levels.  A 12-space parking garage would be located on the first level. 
The other new lot would continue to be used for parking and vehicle repair.  The
proposed project is located in an RSD (Residential-Service Mixed Use) Zoning
District.
