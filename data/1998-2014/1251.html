<ul>
<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I am here because I am concerned about the EIR, about the procedures and about the content.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">On the procedure issue &ndash; it is my understanding that last night we were supposed to have a public discussion on the EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">That public discussion was not held in the community.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">So I don't know what the legal ramifications are or whether there will still be time to have a community meeting on the EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The second part of my concern has to do with the content of the EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The EIR mentions the 49ers corporation.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We on the Project Area Committee have never discussed the 49er area.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Mayor's Office certainly has never come and talked to us about what is going to happen there.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We don't know anything.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I have been bringing this up since approximately September, about how come the 49ers don't show up?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> How come the Mayor's Office doesn't come over?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">So [if] there is content in the EIR, we in the Project Area Committee know nothing about it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has never been discussed.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I just would like you to be aware of that.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We in District 10 like diversity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We want change.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We like to embrace new things and new horizons.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">But at this point, with this project and this EIR, it has caused a great division in my community.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">It has caused me to come here today to share my concerns because it is just not right - the process that has been done is just not right.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Voices from the whole community have actually not been heard regarding this EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I speak on behalf of our community like Hunters Point; communities like Sunnydale; communities like Oakdale; tenant associations on Harbor Road and Marina Village.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">This impacts the communities that have not actually had the opportunity to digest this information, let alone delve into the EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We asked in detail about the traffic analysis, about the sewer plants, about the PG&amp;E plants.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">These are things you need to be looking at.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">In addition to that, I don't know and I don't believe it was discussed in detail about our health and safety.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Bear in mind that we like change, but yet they don't deal with our social concerns, our social issues.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">That is something that Redevelopment does not deal with.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">And that is massive in Bayview Hunters point, Little Hollywood, and Vis Valley.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">How can we be stakeholders in the community plan?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We want to make change, but not like that.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">An Environmental Impact Report is developed so that the community that is impacted may understand some or many of the adverse impacts in the area that the Report addresses.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I urge you commissioners, do not certify this EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The main reason is there are important issues like a traffic analysis; pollution; cultural resources; and I could name 40 other impacts that have not been addressed in this EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">This area that you are talking about is over 2,500 acres.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">In order to give you some idea, the Presidio is 1,480 acres.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We are talking about a vast area that is going to impact mostly poor people, and the poor people have not been approached with compassion so they could understand the issues at hand.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Commissioners, I'm asking you to put yourselves in the shoes of many people that will be impacted by this very fake and faulty EIR.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Just what type of safeguard is being put in place to protect the people of the Bayview Hunters Point?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">As an example, I was a merchant in South of Market for 36 years.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Redevelopment came in and purchased the building where my store was located.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">After I made the move, I was told I shouldn't transfer my liquor license.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I couldn't be grandfathered in.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I had an arbitration hearing at the Relocation Appeals Board where Eugene Coleman is the Secretary.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I was raised here in the city.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I used to take the bus from the Fillmore in the Western Addition in the  60s.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Although the neighborhood was suffering at the time, it has been completely destroyed by the Redevelopment process.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I ask the commissioners here what has actually changed in the Redevelopment process since that time?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Has there ever been a real consistent definition of what constitutes blight or public necessity?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Eminent Domain is a powerful tool used by the Redevelopment Agency from time to time.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I currently myself am a victim of a flawed process.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The city is trying to take a property of mine for no good reason.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">There are no rules of evidence, like a criminal or civil procedure.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You can be accused or something like having a property the city needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But they have absolutely no requirement to provide evidence that the need is verifiable, or to show there is any substantial benefit to the city.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I would urge that the Redevelopment Agency really take strong steps to reform their process and also to address the epidemic of eminent domain misuse and abuse across the country, wherein governments, municipal and Redevelopment Agencies take private property from one person, take out a small business loan, take a person out of their house and give it to a private developer for private development and private profit.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I would just like to mention that as one person did today, this would not have happened in a richer white neighborhood.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I was part of a firm that worked with the Bayview Hunters Point area to select or elect of have elected a PAC.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I worked with that community to inform them of what the goals and the mission was of the Redevelopment Agency and what the role of the PAC would be.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Tonight I stand before you to tell you that in my personal opinion, the Redevelopment Commission and staff owe the Planning Commission and staff an apology.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">We are here tonight speaking as if we are on the final certification of the EIR because of the manner in which the Redevelopment Agency botched what it did in terms of presenting it to the community and the PAC in a fashion where it could be understood, mitigated, modified, and then accepted by a broader section of the community.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm appalled that a notice went out just a few days ago of a special meeting of the PAC in Bayview Hunters Point with an agenda item, number 6 I believe, a Workshop on the Environmental Impact Report.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Yes, you had it in December of 2004.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">But don't you think it is odd that there was just a meeting scheduled with an agenda item yesterday for a workshop to be held with the PAC, giving the PAC no time to even work with the community?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You as a joint committee have a responsibility to correct what your predecessors have done incorrectly.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">Listen to the people who have been here, who have compassionately asked you not to eliminate what has been done, but to give them time to process what has been written so that they can understand it, give their input, and then let it proceed.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The process was not a good one.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">The Redevelopment Agency and its staff came to the community late with the information.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">I got a copy of it yesterday myself.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">So how on earth could a community intelligently come together on something that they received so very late from you?</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">It is only fair to respect the community who has come to appeal to you a process and ask you to give them time to give the Redevelopment Agency time to correct its efforts and come back to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Have the workshop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Explain it and expand it so that all of the social issues that should be there are in fact put there.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">But you were set up to come back in here, discriminate against people, don't give them any jobs, put the Police Department out there in the community, and all of the agencies of the city work for justification to push people out because you get big money from the people that run for office.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">You don't care what happens to black people.</font></li>

<li><font face="Arial" size="2">To me that means a home in a mixed-use neighborhood would be at risk of eminent domain.</font></li>
