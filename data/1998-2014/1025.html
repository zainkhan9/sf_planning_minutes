        <ul><ul><p><u>150 BROADWAY (AKA 190 BROADWAY</u>) - Construction of Affordable Housing, Childcare Facility, Retail Space and Parking. Lot 011 of Assessor's Block 0141 - <font class="heading2">Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration</font> for the proposed new construction of 87 affordable housing units, 41 off-street parking spaces (including 3 spaces for the City CarShare Program), a 3,500 square foot childcare facility, a community room, multi-purpose room and offices associated with the residential use, 2,000 square feet of retail space, and one freight-loading space. The proposed project would consist of three separate buildings:  one building would be three-stories tall, or approximately 40 feet in height; a second structure would be five-stories tall, or approximately 50 feet in height; and the third structure would be eight-stories tall, or approximately 80-feet tall. The proposed structures would contain approximately 128,000 gross square feet.  The site is approximately 30,948 square feet in size and located at the northeast corner of Broadway and Battery Streets, with additional frontage on Front Street.  The site currently contains a ground-level asphalt parking lot on a portion of the site and the remainder of the site is vacant.  The site was also the former site of the Embarcadero Freeway off-ramp, and is owned by the City and County of San Francisco. The project site is located within a C-2 (Community Business) zoning district, the Northern Waterfront Special Use District No. 3, the Northeastern Historic District, and an 84-E height and bulk district.  The proposed project requires Conditional Use Authorization and a Certificate of Appropriateness.</p>

        <p>between Battery and Front Streets; Lot 011 in Assessors Block 0141 - The proposal is to construct a new mid-rise building that will contain 87 units of affordable housing with retail, childcare, and community spaces, built over an underground parking level accessed from Front Street and containing up to 41 off-street spaces. This project is proposed for land that is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works (DPW) and is partially leased to a parking vendor.  The Board of Supervisors previously approved in principle the transfer of the property from DPW to the Mayor's Office of Housing for the development of affordable housing.  A General Plan Referral is needed at this time in order for the Board of Supervisors to consider (a) lease disposition and development agreement that will allow the affordable housing developer, Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC), to move forward with development activities, and (b) a future ground lease between the City and Chinatown CDC to be entered into at the start of construction.  The subject property is zoned C-2 (Community Business), is in the Northern Waterfront S.U.D. No. 3, and in an 84-E Height and Bulk District.  </p>

The proposed addition and renovated 150 Powell Street building would have four stories, approximately 65 feet tall, and would include retail space, and an approximately 3,600 gross square foot landscaped courtyard and lobby on the first floor.  Both alternatives require a determination of compliance with the Planning Code pursuant to Section 309, with an exception to loading requirements. No parking would be provided as part of the Project.  The subject site is within a C-3-R (Downtown Retail) District, an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District, and the Kearny-Market-Mason-Sutter Conservation District. Option (1) would provide ground floor, basement, and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for up to 50 dwelling units, all uses permitted as of right. This alternative requires an additional exception under Section 309 (rear yard), and also must obtain variances from residential parking (13 spaces), dwelling unit exposure, and open space requirements, at a concurrent hearing before the Zoning Administrator. Option (2) would provide ground floor and mezzanine retail, with the upper three stories used for up to 50 units of time share condominiums, categorized as a &quot;hotel&quot; use under the Planning Code and requiring a Conditional Use authorization.

        <p>- Believes it is important to refurbish these properties.  Many are made in architectural designs that are important to San Francisco and were constructed in an era that workmanship was valued.</p>

        <p>- By tearing down these small more affordable properties, you allow the developers to make huge profits and build units that are outside the range of the average San Franciscan.   </p>

        <p>- Please do not let profit become the motive for tearing down pieces of San Francisco, that can house families, seniors, renters--thereby keeping our families here in San Francisco rather than have them relocate to San Pablo, Pittsburgh, Vallejo, etc.</p>

        <p>- Report is very thorough but it does not mention a very important feature that should be taken into account:  what is the age of the house?  This should be considered independent of the question of soundness.</p>

        <p>- There is a suggestion in the report that increases the threshold of an upgrade cost to 75% in cases that are called owner neglect.  He has handled quite few of these cases and can tell you that there is no agreement on how to distinguish owner neglect from normal aging or construction deficiency.  This is an area that needs more analysis and consideration.</p>

        <p>- One of the replacement policy in the draft, one of the things you look at it is that the replacement building provides family housing--that becomes a plus.</p>

        <p>- Others special-needs housing identified in the General Plan as high need is elderly housing and group housing for mentally disabled adults.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Daniela Kirshenbaum</font></p>

        <p>- This report is a big step in the right direction</p>

        <p>- Neighborhood character is something that we always we need to think about, and it is spelled out in this report.</p>

        <p>- It is hard to find opportunities where demolitions have enhanced neighborhood character. </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Pat Buscovich</font></p>

        <p>- A lot of these buildings were built a long time ago and they are not functional today.</p>

        <p>- We need to look at single-family homes differently than multi-family housing.</p>

        <p>- Reports need to be done by people who do not have a financial interest, but an interest in the design so you can get an un-bias report. </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donoghue</font></p>

        <p>- In the 1960s and 1970s the rate of demolition was .3%, 1500 to 1900 units per year. Today the rate of demolition is about .4% and single family homes today are .01% to .03% of that.  </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Charlie Varon</font></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">-     </font>Let's be very careful when we think about demolition.  Think about the architectural heritage, historical heritage, or the cultural heritage, that we are taking away from our kids.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Hiroshi Fukuda</font></p>

        <p>- We need to create a more efficient and accurate demolition system to be able to preserve our buildings and neighborhoods.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Gary Gee</font></p>

        <p>- The criteria for a minimum  two-bedroom units is maybe too strict.  It does not allow flexibility.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Dick Millet</font></p>

        <p>- Something has to be done.  We need to go back to 1300 sq. ft.  This will give 3 bedrooms and 2 baths and families might be able to live there, instead of these great luxury homes [where most of them can't].</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Shawn Gorman</font></p>

        <p>- Design is really a separate issue from demolition.  It is tied more often than not to cases coming before you as a result of a demolition occurring before the residential design can be approved.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

        <p>- Concerned about the Commission voting on this, until after the demolition issue is settled at the Board of Supervisors.  Much of what is in this seems to be what is in front of the Board of Supervisors, and some the wording seems to be extremely controversial.</p>

        <p>- Believes that you might be breaking CEQA by doing a policy like this and not doing it jointly with the Housing Element.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Kepa Acknowsky</font></p>

        <p>- Would like to request that this type of study expand to include other zoning areas in San Francisco.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

        <p>- Regarding Recommendation 13:  Someone buys a property that has a failure of maintenance from the prior owner.  That could not work, because 1) there will be collusive transactions to avoid; 2) property would be priced as a tear down.  If you want to keep the land value down so that someone who has the hope of buying a condemned building, you have to take the value for rehabbing a demolition out of that property.  You are not going to do it.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Joe Buttler </font></p>

        <p>- The soundness report formula that is currently in place could be reasonably applied to the majority of buildings that are more than 50 years of age, due to the code upgrade, seismic and otherwise.  A broader context view of demolition within the neighborhood should be considered, and those parts in the master plan excluded from the summary of the demolition policy today, should be included.  </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Judy Berkowitz</font></p>

        <p>- One of the things that she is particularly concerned about is the 2/3 of the interior demolition without notice. </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Alice Barkley</font></p>

        <p>- In terms of the old buildings, it mentions in the report that the environmental evaluation would hold out those buildings with architectural merit and historical significance.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Marilyn Amini</font></p>

        <p>- Urged the Commission not to act on the demolition policy until you hear fully the Housing Element, and take public comment.</p>

  </ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">ACTION:</font> Meeting held.  No action required.</p>

              <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the building permit as submitted.</p>

              <p>(Continued from Regular Hearing of May 1, 2003)</p>

              <p><font class="heading2">SPEAKER (S)</font>:   </p>

    </ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">David Aranika, First Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- There are some exceptional and extraordinary circumstances surrounding this project.</p>

        <p>- One of his concerns with the proposed project has to do with the second and third floors of the building and the depth of the building.</p>

        <p>- Their air and light to adjacent properties is significantly diminished.</p>

        <p>- Asked the Commission to consider the impact to his light, space and visual [view].</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Joe Buttler, Representing Second Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The overlapping of these four corner lots and their shallow buildings meets the minimum standards of the Planning Code.  If applied to the sponsor's application, it would not adequately protect the light and air of the three other homes.</p>

      </ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Dick Meister</font></p>

        <ul><p>- What it amounts to is the question of fairness and equity.</p>

        <p>- It violates the privacy and light of two neighbors.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Gerry Meister</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Would like the same standards that have been previously al\pplied in the neighborhood be applied on this project.</p>

        <p>- Minimal reduction inside has been asked for.  It would be a good service to the neighborhood if it is granted.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">James Haire</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The subject house is the oldest on this part of the hill.  In essence, it has some historic value.</p>

        <p>- Strongly supports the project.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Jim Ruben, representing Project Sponsor</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The rear yard, that has been retained is 40%, not 25%.</p>

        <p>- This is a modest extension at most.</p>

        <p>- There is no way either the first and second floor could impact either of the Discretionary Review requestors.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor wants to preserve a house that obviously contributes to the character of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- Opposing the retention of the house and its renovation in a way that is a practical solution is not good to anybody right now.</p>

        <p>- Asked the Commission to not take Discretionary Review and follow staff`s recommendations.</p>

      </ul><p><font class="heading2">Bill</font> <font class="heading2">Pashelincky, Architect of the Project</font></p>

        <ul><p>- Gave a general description of the project</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Mary Sangiacomo</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Always been her dream to restore a Victorian home and make it her family home.</p>

        <p>- This home has a very rich history.</p>

        <p>- The house cannot presently be occupied.  To make it livable for her family, they needs to extend the rear to modestly increase the size of the building.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">James McFadden</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Strongly supports this project.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Steven Aiello</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- There is a well established pattern of three-story buildings on this block.</p>

        <p>- These people are saving a home that could easily be demolished.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p>- They are keeping the roof down instead of doing a cathedral-style roof in the back. </p>

              <p><font class="heading2">ACTION:</font> Did not take Discretionary Review and approved as submitted.</p>

        <p>16. 2003.0312D  (M. SNYDER: (415) 575-6891)</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><u>761 KANSAS STREET</u> - east side between 19th Street and 20th Street, Lot 17 in Assessor's Block 4073 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.10.25.0003 proposing to construct a vertical and rear horizontal addition, as well as a new front facade.  The property is within an RH-2 (House, Two-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  </p>

              <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and approve the project with modifications.</p>

              <p>(Continued from Regular Hearing of May 1, 2003)</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p>SPEAKER (S):</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Lou and Ruth Goldheimer, Discretionary Review Requestors</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Supports their new neighbor's need to expand and enhance their home</p>

        <p>- Has agreed that a third floor on top of the second will provide them with the space they want.</p>

        <p>- Would like to emphasis their two goals for this Discretionary Review: 1) The rear depth of the house be modified to be in line with and comparable to the adjacent neighbors; 2) the mass and volume of the house be mitigated by progressive setbacks that would preserve some neighbors access to sun, air, and views.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Katherine Krebs</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Concerned about the preservation of the beauty and character of their neighborhood.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">-</font> The volume and mass of the proposed building must be mitigated by the use of progressive setbacks so it is comparable with the rest of the neighborhood.</p>

      </ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Rose O'Leary (Spoke on behalf of Rubin Sutherland)</font></p>

        <ul><p>- Supports Discretionary Review</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Philip E. LeMaster</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This building does not fit the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The style looks like it belongs in an intercity office complex of cement, glass, and steel in the shape of a box.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Pam Davis</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This alteration does not add to the housing stock.  There is no justification for tripling the size of the home.</p>

        <p>- This is a single-family dwelling.</p>

        <p>- The builders are not planning to make this home two units.</p>

        <p>- There is absolutely no advantage to the City and the taxpayers for a house of this dimension.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Robert Graham</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This project is totally out of character with the neighborhood.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Michelle Garside</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Asked the Commission to use their power and do what it says in the Planning Code.</p>

        <p>- We would like to preserve our neighborhood.  It is a very special place because we love how we live there.  We do not live big.      </p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Judith Leash</font> </p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Urged the Commission to consider the guidelines adopted in 1989 and to review neighborhood comparability.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Gregg Goddard</font></p>

</ul></ul><p>    -     Supports Discretionary Review.</p>

    <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Miguelina Perez</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Supports Discretionary Review.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Ben Goldheimmer</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The proposed new home is not in keeping with the sizes of the homes currently on this block.</p>

        <p>- The project designer is proposing a home that is nearly 4.000 square feet, while the other three-story structures are approximately 2500 square feet.  This is 1500 square feet larger than the norm.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Garry Sinclair</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This project will greatly impact their garden.</p>

        <p>- They would lose their privacy.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Kris Gardner</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- I'm here today to support the residential design guidelines.</p>

        <p>- The project before you proposes a design that is in conflict with the residential design guidelines in the following area:  the addition proposes an extension into the rear yard that is greater than a garden level floor.</p>

        <p>- The proposed rear yard extension is out of alignment with the adjoining neighbors to the south as well as to the north.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Catherine Wayland</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Concerned about retaining the integrity of the Potrero Hill Neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- Concerned about building Monster Homes that will impact the sun, air, and light of the neighborhood.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Tito Patri</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Urged the Commission to require the proponents to go back to the drawing board and design something that is neighborly, not necessarily just according to the rules.</p>

      </ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Dick Millet</font></p>

        <ul><p>- The design is beautiful, it is just in the wrong place.  The character is wrong for this place, and it is not in the single-family zone.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Steve Williams, representing John and Triny Artol</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- How is this not a demolition?  Look at the plans.  The Department has to explain how this is not a demolition when all you are saving is just a little bit of a wall.</p>

        <p>- Even what we proposed to you today would at least make it a major alteration.  </p>

        <p>- Urged the Commission, as part of the Discretionary review, to put this scheme back in place.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Joel Yodowitz</font></p>

        <p>- The Discretionary Review requestors conveniently omitted from their drawings the fact they have a rear yard cottage and 100% lot coverage themselves. They also miss-categorized the remaining rear yards in the block.</p>

        <p>- The proposed project comes in about 66 feet.  As you can see, several of the other buildings are larger than that. There is no specific continuance of space.</p>

        <p>- The proposed house would be about 3480 square feet, not 4100 square feet as the Discretionary Review requestors mentioned tonight.</p>

        <p>- The project impact on light and air has been mis-represented.</p>

        <p>- The subject property is north of the Goldheimers.  It will have a very minimal impact. It will only extended about an additional 13 feet into their year yard.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Robin Coleen, Project Sponsor</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Their renovation respects setbacks.  And because of her love of gardening, this features lots of landscaping elements in the front and rear of the house.</p>

        <p>- This house was conceived as a solar house.  We hoped that the energy efficiency of it would inspire more on the hill to use solar power.</p>

        <p>- In our design, we made considerable efforts to accommodate our neighbors--lapping off corners, preserving setbacks, moving a balcony to preserve one of the neighbors' privacy, lowering solar panels, etc.  In fact, we have made many compromises over the last nine months through many meetings.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">David Coleen, Project Sponsor </font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This is an old house that has two substandard additions.  In the structural evaluations we found out that these additions are about to fall down.  We will take them down before they fall down.  The main part of the house will stay.  We have an addition proposed in the back and an additional floor added to the top.</p>

        <p>- We have been through a lengthy process here.  We have been working with our neighbors for nine months now.  We had over thirty design meetings with neighbors including the Goldheimers.</p>

        <p>- We are proposing to renovate a house completely within the rules.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center"><font class="heading2">Chris Thompson</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- He is in support of the builders of this building largely because he is simpatehic to the ardorous nature of the task at hand--trying to get a project approved in the City.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Peter Eurenever</font></p>

        <p>- Supports the project because it adds to the energy on the hill.</p>

    </ul></ul><p align="center">-     The design fits in with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Babette Drefke</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- Found that all the proposed improvements are within the Planning Code.  Therefore it is necessary to side with those who are trying to improve the neighborhood.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>-     Urged the Commission to approve the application.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">ACTION:</font> Approved as modified:</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p>- Provide a consistent three-foot side setback for the last nine-feet of depth of the addition on its southern side; and</p>

        <p>- Reduce the height of the clearstory by one-foot and increase its setback from the front building wall by three-feet.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>2146 45TH AVENUE</u> - east side between Quintara and Rivera Avenues.  Assessor's Block 2173 Lot 040 - Request for Discretionary Review of Building Permit Application No. 2002.1204.2727, to construct a two story horizontal addition to the rear of the existing one story, single family in an RH-1 (Residential, House, 1 Family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.    </p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Take Discretionary Review and Modify the Project</p>

    </ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Tana Hall</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The proposal as it stands, is very insensitive to the neighborhood and increases the value and enjoyment of one property at the expense of all the others on the block.  It is also at the expense of the character of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The height is too tall for the area.  The bulk and its encroachment into the rear yard impacts open space.  They are building to the full legal limit of the property.  They lack good neighbor features to mitigate the negative impacts, which are increased density, lost open space, views and privacy.</p>

      </ul><p><font class="heading2">Kelly Stanley  (read a letter from Ellen Mary James-Smith)</font></p>

        <ul><p>- Privacy, view, quality of open space, increased density in the neighborhood, and the worry that such a large building would be used for multiple families are all immediate concerns.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Dennis Young, Architect, representing Project Sponsor</font></p>
