25.<b> CERTIFICATION OF FINAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (FEIR)</b>. The
project is demolition of a three-story building with frontage on both Dolores
and 16th Streets, and construction of a two-story, building on the same
part of the site. The building to be demolished was designed by Willis
Polk and Company, and was determined to appear eligible for listing on
the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). The building was used
for child care from about 1912, until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
A building constructed in 1984 would remain and continue to provide classrooms
and other facilities for child care, and two, one-story, 960-sq.-ft. temporary
buildings would be removed after project construction. The new building
would continue the child care use, adding about 50 children to the approximately
100 existing children, for a total of 150 children. There would be a net
reduction of about 2,830 sq. ft. at the site. The site served 150 children
prior to 1989, and now serves 100 children. The new building would enable
the site to serve 150 children, with approval of an amendment to the existing
Conditional Use authorization.</font>
