The addition, like the existing commercial building, would cover the entire small site.  No parking would be provided.  Both a parking and a rear yard/site coverage variance would be required and will be considered by the Zoning Administrator at the same hearing as the Conditional Use authorization.  Required open space would be provided on a rooftop terrace.</p>

  <ul><p>2. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

    <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Planning Director Search Status</i></p>

    <p>- He is receiving a lot of calls related to the status for the search of a Planning Director.  What is the status?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Planning Director Search Status</i></p>

    <p>- Since she returned from her trip she has not had time to speak to the Chair of the search committee.  As soon as that is done, she will communicate with the Commissioners.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- She has asked this before and wants to know how this item can be scheduled for discussion?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- He is not ready to give his comment about this today but with a bit of research the issue can be discussed in order to know how this Commission's practice is related to the other Commissions and Board of Supervisors.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- Does the public comment period last 15 minutes?</p>

      <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commission Secretary Responded:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

      <p>- When she started with the Commission there was no time limit on general public comment.</p>

      <p>- At one time, it seemed that too much time was devoted to this and it caused an impact on items that were scheduled behind it.  They tried setting a 15 minute time limit, but it was not usually followed.  Ultimately, following a public hearing, the Commission amended their Rules and Regulations to change the Order of Business for their public meetings, and placed Public Comment at the end of the calendar.</p>

    </ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- She is open to discuss this issue.</p>

    <p>- She is interested in seeing the research.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner William Lee:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- This should be scheduled.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Bringing Back Public Comment to the Beginning of the Calendar</i></p>

    <p>- She would like to have this issue scheduled when there is a full Commission.</p>

      <ul><p><font class="heading2">Director Green responded:</font></p>

      <p>- He will work with Ms. Avery and provide this information to the Commission ahead of time.</p>

</ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

  <ul><p>3. Director's Announcements</p>

    <ul><p><i>Re:  Briefing on the SRO Policies</i></p>

    <p>- This will be scheduled on September 23, 2004 under Director's Report.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Listing of all Major Environmental Review on Major City Work</i></p>

    <p>- He placed in the Commissioner's correspondence folder a draft with this information.</p>

    <p>- The Commission should look this over and make comments at the next hearing, which will be September 23, 2004.</p>

  </ul><p>4. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

    <ul><p><font class="heading2">BOS - None</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOA - None</font></p>

  </ul><p>5.                     (L. BADINER: (415) 558-6350)</p>

    <ul><p>Status Report on 727 Van Ness Avenue as a response to comments raised during Public Comment at the Planning Commission hearing on September 2, 2004.</p>

    <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">John Sanger - Representing Van Ness Towers</font></p>

    <p>- He is aware of the request for Discretionary Review and request for determination.</p>

    <p>- There are some things that he disagrees with Mr. Badiner on.</p>

    <p>- Both applications are before the Commission.</p>

    <p>- The plans attached to the permit application were not sufficient to DBI.</p>

    <p>- There was a necessity for a Variance on rear yard and parking requirements.</p>

    <p>- There was an appeal of the Variance decision, which added 5 months to the timeline after the Conditional Use was approved.</p>

    <p>- He will be submitting a brief on this.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Charles Marsteller</font></p>

    <p>- He is concerned about the policy aspects of this decision.</p>

    <p>- It is important for the Planning Commission to review this project.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

    <p>- The Commission is being made a &quot;laughing stock&quot; if they allow staff to change the policy of a project.</p>

    <p>- The Commission should bring this back and review the changes.</p>

    <p>ACTION: No Action Required.</p>

    <p>6. 1999.210C (J. PURVIS: 415-558-6354)</p>

    <p><u>3620 19th STREET</u> - north side between Guerrero and Oakwood Streets; Lots 18, 68, 70 in Assessor's Block 3752 - <font class="heading2">Status report</font> and Commission comment on a 39-unit residential planned unit development approved by the Planning Commission under Motion No. 16134 on April 5, 2001, and amended, on appeal, by the Board of Supervisors under Board Resolution No. M01-76 on July 2, 2001.   The project site has been sold and the new owners have modified the design.  It is within an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) and RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Use District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.</p>

    <p>(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 2, 2004)</p>

    <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Andrew Junius</font></p>

    <p>- There was a very significant community meeting.</p>

    <p>- They are very confident that many if not all of the concerns have been addressed.</p>

    <p>- Removal of underground parking, reduction of units, significant addition to the landscaping.</p>

    <p>- There are a lot of other minor changes that were required by the Board of Supervisors.</p>

    <p>- He looks forward to moving ahead as quickly as possible.</p>

    <p>- The project team is available to answer any questions.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Saandra Nazzal</font></p>

    <p>- Is the project a new subdivision and will it be processed as a new subdivision?</p>

    <p>- If there is an appeal period, when would it start?</p>

    <p>- Will the Commission make a ruling today?</p>

    <p>- She was not aware of the previous meeting.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eileen Gold</font></p>

    <p>- She has lived on 19<sup>th</sup> Street for 18 years.</p>

    <p>- This plan has been an issue to all the neighbors.</p>

    <p>- The lives of the neighbors will be disrupted for a year while this is being constructed.</p>

    <p>- Why can't the Planning Department work with DBI to deal with the issues.</p>

    <p>- The developer is winning and the neighborhood needs to win also.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Cordelia Brown</font></p>

    <p>- Her family recently purchased a home on Oakwood Street.</p>

    <p>- They are planning to reside in the back cottage that's adjacent to the project.</p>

    <p>- They will have to take out a back wall that was put in illegally.  The window they will install will face the windows of the proposed project.</p>

    <p>- There is a great deal of discrepancies between the plans and the actual project.</p>

    <p>- He presented documentation on why this report is inaccurate and misleading.</p>

    <p>- He urges the Commission to consider this.</p>

    <p>- They took the Commissioner's concerns quite seriously.</p>

    <p>- They devised and went back to the Discretionary Review requester with revised plans.</p>

    <p>- He had not received a response until a day before yesterday, which did not allow enough time to provide the appropriate copies to the department.</p>

    <p>- The Commission did not give direction to preserve views.</p>

    <p>- He displayed a diagram of the fa&ccedil;ade of the building.</p>

    <p>- He feels that they have been quite reasonable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Christopher Moscone</font></p>

    <p>- He did respond to Mr. Sanger's proposal and they did take some time to respond because of vacations, etc.</p>

    <p>- He did not get a response to their response until [just] before the hearing.</p>

    <p>- He appreciates the time that the Commission has taken on this and will allow more time if necessary to try to work out  minor differences.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Claire Pilcher</font></p>

    <p>- This is not a view issue as Mr. Sanger states.</p>

    <p>- The garden in the back of one of the neighbors is actually unbelievable so the issue here is not about view but of livability.</p>

    <p>- This project is being built to the maximum capacity.</p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission to reduce the density and the number of units and make the units larger.</p>

    <p>- There are safety concerns related to SRO's.</p>

    <p>- He feels that a Mandatory Discretionary Review would be most adequate.</p>

    <p>- They are enjoying their family life.</p>

    <p>- Their house is located in the back of the permit applicant's house.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Eileen Boken</font></p>

    <p>- She is opposed to the project because of the size of the project and for neighborhood character.</p>

    <p>- When this neighborhood was built, it was designed with very few parks.  The neighborhood was single-family homes.</p>

    <p>- The back yards should be preserved for open space.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mavis Nathan</font></p>

    <p>- She has never received any notification of this project.  Her neighbors notified her.</p>

    <p>- She objects to the project because the project would set a precedent in favor of much larger homes in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- This will change the character of the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Deborah Brown</font></p>

    <p>- The character of the neighborhood would be disrupted if this project were approved.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications</p>

    </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ray Chang - 1<sup>st</sup> Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

    <p>- There are only five houses on the block that have ever been renovated or extended.</p>

    <p>- The proposed project does not fit into the character of the block or our neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- There does not seem to be any consideration of the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

    <p>- If the project goes through as is, his home will be devalued.</p>

    <p>- The project sponsor suggested painting the wall where the addition is going to be.  He does not care about the color because he does not want that wall there.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marcela Roar - 2<sup>nd</sup> Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

    <p>- None of the neighbors in the area were notified until they received notification from the City.</p>

    <p>- They are concerned about the negative impact this construction will have on their homes, open space and the integrity of the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- The project should be modified by reducing the height 12 feet and the rear extension 18 feet.</p>

    <p>- Her husband gets up at 5:30 a.m. to walk or jog so he goes to sleep early.  [The way the houses are now we] can hear noises from the adjacent house.  She requested that a sound wall be installed.  A building inspector should also be hired to ensure that the materials used in the project are of the highest quality.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Eileen Bocken</font></p>

    <p>- She opposes the project.  She lives one block away from the project.</p>

    <p>- The size is too massive and she is concerned with its compatibility with the other homes.</p>

    <p>- There have been a number of transactions in the Assessor's records.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sara Del Monte</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- She does not see why the project sponsor needs to build such a monstrosity.</p>

    <p>- The homes in the neighborhood are single-family homes.</p>

    <p>- She treasures San Francisco enough [to oppose this].</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ellen Chiang</font></p>

    <p>- She was born and raised in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- This addition is too large for the mid-block open space.</p>

    <p>- The area is zoned for single family homes.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rex McClain - Project Architect</font></p>

    <p>- The project sponsors want to add bedrooms and a bath.</p>

    <p>- The project sponsors have a large family.</p>

    <p>- He feels that having four bedrooms is not an unreasonable expectation.</p>

    <p>- Although leaving the first floor open is odd to the project sponsor, they will be using the space as a covered out door patio for their children to play when there is bad weather.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Victoria Liveron</font></p>

    <p>- She and her husband are planning to have another child for a total of three.</p>

    <p>- Many of the homes in the neighborhood have gone through renovations.</p>

    <p>- They have tried to design the smallest possible addition allowable.</p>

    <p>- The empty space on the first floor will be used as a family room or as an enclosed play area.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Alex Liveron</font></p>

    <p>- The requestor's bedroom has a large top to bottom patio door where sun will not be blocked.</p>

    <p>- They made an offer to the Discretionary Review requestors in order to deal with the issues they have.</p>

    <p>- He has a list of things that they would like to offer to the DR requestors that is available to the Commission.</p>

    <p>- There are support letters from the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and modified the project by:  the two story horizontal rear addition is not to exceed 13 feet from the existing rear wall.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Steve Williams - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

    <p>- Single-family homes are being lost.</p>

    <p>- This housing is occupied and has been occupied since it was first purchased.</p>

    <p>- The intention from the beginning was to destroy the house.</p>

    <p>- The soundness report does not have accurate figures.</p>

    <p>- The size of the lots is small and extremely substandard.</p>

    <p>- This house should be saved.  The 3-&#189; foot setback should be retained.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Suzanne Dumont</font></p>

    <p>- She is opposed to the project because it will demolish perfectly sound housing.</p>

    <p>- She is opposed to the demolition.</p>

    <p>- The Commission can save the wholesale [demolition] of single-family homes.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Winnie Siegel - Little House Committee </font></p>

    <p>- She speaks for preservation.</p>

    <p>- The Commission should decide for repair and not demolition.</p>

    <p>- The house could be purchased as a starter home.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mrs. Anderson</font></p>

    <p>- She opposes the demolition.</p>

    <p>- There have been eight demolitions and new constructions recently.</p>

    <p>- Because of these projects, the noise and traffic is affecting the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- There are no buildings that are four stories over garage.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Klaus Wirsing</font></p>

    <p>- The three houses on Diamond Street are a cluster of small lots.</p>

    <p>- The new construction will dramatically change the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- There is a lot of anger brewing in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dick Meister</font></p>

    <p>- He lives on 28<sup>th</sup> Street.</p>

    <p>- All the points have been made already.</p>

    <p>- He is opposed to the demolition.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Margaret Hoppe</font></p>

    <p>- She lives four doors down.</p>

    <p>- She is opposed to the monster homes going up in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- She read a letter from Vicky Rosen who is opposed to the project.</p>

    <p>- The proposal is not harmonious with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mr. Anderson</font></p>

    <p>- This type of redevelopment in the neighborhood is hurting it.</p>

    <p>- If a modest addition is intended, then it should be done following all the requirements and communicating with the neighbors.</p>

    <p>- There will be a lot of construction noise as well.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Harry Jeong</font></p>

    <p>- He lives across the street from the subject project.</p>

    <p>- He requested Discretionary Review on this property.</p>

    <p>- He sees that only cosmetic renovations need to be done to the project.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gerry Meister</font></p>

    <p>- She lives on 28<sup>th</sup> Street.</p>

    <p>- Most all of the points have been made and she wanted to echo the sentiments.</p>

    <p>- She opposes the demolition.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Peter Culley</font></p>

    <p>- He is a registered Structural Engineer and has been for about 40 years.</p>

    <p>- Many of the previous speakers have questioned the logic of the soundness report.</p>

    <p>- He examined the site and determined that there is no hillside sliding.</p>

    <p>- He gave a technical explanation of why the house does not need to be demolished.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Joe Butler</font></p>

    <p>- There is a small wide lot.</p>

    <p>- This proposed construction will tower over the adjacent houses.</p>

    <p>- He showed photographs of how the project would cause shadows over the neighbors.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Judith Hoyem</font></p>

    <p>- The planning code has priority policies to preserve existing character.  It seems extremely wasteful to demolish this house.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) David Mielder</font></p>

    <p>- There have been recommendations to reduce the a section by 12 feet and pull the house back from the property line by three feet and the new plans reflect that.  The back area has been lowered an additional three feet.</p>

    <p>- The other issue here is the rights of a property owner compared to the rights of the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- Since this has to be negotiated with the people that it impacts, they have made revisions to the plans to reflect their issues.</p>

    <p>- He mentioned that although this is the developer's project, he as well and the project architect live in the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) James Lee</font></p>

    <p>- This mid-block open space is very special for everyone on the block.</p>

    <p>- This project would extend to the maximum allowable buildable area.</p>

    <p>- The subject property is one of the largest on the block already.</p>

    <p>- A proposal for a large remodel was approved by the Commission for another neighbor. However, there were conditions and reductions made to that project.</p>

    <p>- Therefore, it would be appropriate to take Discretionary Review because the design of the project is not compatible with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- The mid-block open space is a natural resource that the neighbors must protect.</p>

    <p>- He lives on 23<sup>rd</sup> Avenue.</p>

    <p>- He renovated his house when his family got larger.</p>

    <p>- This beautiful Edwardian will be brought to modern times.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Edward Lee</font></p>

    <p>- He has lived in the Richmond for about 12 years.</p>

    <p>- He is aware of the beautiful mid-block open space.</p>

  <p><i>Re:  170 St. Germain </i></p>

  <p>- He was unable to speak last week when this case was discussed during Director's Report.</p>

  <p>- His personal integrity was questioned and he wants to clarify some issues.</p>

  <p>- There was a notice of violation issued on August 6, 2004 and a complaint on August 6, 2004.</p>

  <p>- He had spoken to the district building inspector at that time.  He had also reviewed the permit and seen the photographs that the Discretionary Review requestor's representative had illegally entered the site to take.  The inspector visited the site and was not concerned because he had determine that the house was not habitable.</p>

  <p>- After the public hearing was held in July 2004, another inspector was assigned-different from the one who issued the notice of violation.</p>

  <p>- If the Commission or staff have any questions, he is available.</p>

  <p>- He has been doing this for 15 years and has never worked on a case that has caused so much staff time.</p>
