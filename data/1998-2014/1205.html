        <p><u>RINCON HILL PLAN</u> - <b> Certification of Environmental Impact 
          Report</b>. The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area 
          Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls 
          for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes 
          to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District 
          (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon 
          Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase 
          height limits, revise the &quot;R&quot; bulk district, amend the Rincon 
          Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended 
          to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the 
          Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system 
          and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon 
          Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial 
          District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood. 
          The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, 
          The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay 
          Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks.</p>
        <p><b><u>NOTE:</u> The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed. The 
          public comment period for the Draft EIR ended on December 10, 2004. 
          The Planning Commission does not conduct public review of Final EIRs. 
          Public comments on the certification may be presented to the Planning 
          Commission during the Public Comment portion of the Commission calendar.</b></p>

        <p><u>88 FIFTH STREET - THE OLD U.S. MINT</u> - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration</b> - The proposed project is the rehabilitation plus seismic upgrade and addition to the United States Old Mint located at 88 Fifth Street in downtown San Francisco (Assessor's Block 3704, Lot 11).  The existing three-story plus an occupied attic 99,921-gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be retained, and the first floor courtyard enclosed in 1973 for offices would be removed,  (a deduction of 4,336 gsf), and additional circulation bridges, stairs and an elevator (addition of 2,642 gsf) would be added within the existing 4-story courtyard.  The existing attic would be expanded on the roof along the south side of the courtyard to create a museum gallery (an addition of 1,554 gsf) with a view of the city skyline to the south.  The courtyard removal and additions of bridges and roof gallery would result in an overall reduction of gsf, for a total floor area of 99,788 gsf.  The building would include 79,957 square feet if usable space total including: 36,326 sf of City History Museum space, 2,082 sf of Museum office space, 2,045 sf of museum back of house space, 2,044 sf of museum retail, and 3,336 sf of museum theater space.  Tenants in the building would be the 8,153 sf Gold Rush and Money Museum, 2,492 sf of small retail lease spaces, and 6,360 gsf of restaurant space and cafe. 3,987 sf would be used for the San Francisco Visitor Center, and the remaining 11,108 sf would be circulation, toilets and support spaces ancillary to the museum use.  The project would include closure of Jessie Street to vehicles, between Mint and Fifth Streets, to be used for outdoor restaurant seating.  The project site is approximately 47,515 sq. ft., is zoned P (Public) within a 90-X height and bulk district, and within the Mid-Market St. Revitalization and Conservation District.  Transaction document approvals would be required from the Board of Supervisors, and a Certificate of Appropriateness would be required by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re: Demolition Policy</i></p>

        <p>- It would be relevant to have this item on the calendar in the near future.</p>

        <p>- Perhaps it could be refined a little bit.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:</b></p>

              <p>- It would be a good idea to discuss the demolition and unit merger policies since they have never been looked at together.</p>

              <p>- He recommends that this be scheduled after the joint hearing with the Board of Appeals, which is scheduled on June 15, 2005.  Perhaps we can calendar this the first week of July.</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p><i>Re:  Number of Public Housing Units</i></p>

        <p>- He had made a request of staff to contact he Mayor's Office of Housing to receive information on this topic.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>9. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator Badiner reported:</b></p>

        <p>- On Monday, Alicia John-Baptiste and Director Macris reported to the SF STAT group the following:</p>

        <p>- Director Macris gave an overview of the recent progress of the department.</p>

        <p>- He laid out the areas of highest priority and one of those is the backlog.</p>

        <p>- This year there are more applications than last, which contributes to the backlog.</p>

        <p>- The applications require more extensive review.</p>

        <p>- The plan to address the backlog is to bring aboard more employees, revising fee structures, etc.</p>

        <p>- Director Macris laid out what is going on with the long range planning initiatives.</p>

        <p>- It was a very positive presentation.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p>- Did any of the information compare with other cities?</p>

        <p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

        <p>- Since this is not a scheduled item, there can be no dialogue but it can be scheduled either next week or the following.  </p>

        <p>- He recommended that the Commission email questions in order to be better prepared.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>BOS - </b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Government Relations Committee</i></p>

        <p>- The Board and the Mayor put a moratorium on medical cannabis dispensaries.</p>

        <p>- This is part of state law.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Department was instructed to report back within 25 days of actions that had been taken to address the concerns.</p>

        <p>- One of the things found is that there are about 39 medical cannabis dispensaries in San Francisco.  There are about 5 that are delivery only.</p>

        <p>- Everybody agreed at the hearing that this is a necessary service that needs some controls.</p>

        <p>- A few years ago there were only about 20.  Recently there have been a lot more issues to deal with.</p>

        <p>- The Mayor requested that some conditions be placed on these dispensaries.</p>

        <p>- This discussion will continue and he assumes that there will be more conditions placed.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Sutro Tower</i></p>

        <p>- A categorical exemption was filed and was upheld.  So the Discretionary Reviews that had been requested will be rescheduled.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p>- Will the Commission be notified on what process the medical cannabis will take?</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- The legislation will come to the Commission as usual.</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

        <p>- Will the Commission get any information on Supervisor Daly's comments on Rincon Hill?</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- He does not know what information Supervisor Daly's has.  When it is presented at the Board perhaps that is when his comments can be discussed.</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>

        <p>- Are the medical cannabis dispensaries required to get EIR's?</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>No, they are not required to do anything related to environmental review.</p>

          they will agree with the project.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Lou Barberini</b></p>
        <p>- The project will fit into the neighborhood and actually enhance it.</p>

        <p>- The work that the project sponsor does is excellent craftsmanship.</p>
        <p>- The project on Clarendon will be quality craftsmanship as well.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Brian McGee</b></p>
        <p>- The project sponsor is constructing a code-compliant building.</p>
        <p>- The Commission should consider that the project sponsor has come 
          a long way.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Greg Clark</b></p>
        <p>- He is a fourth-generation San Franciscan.</p>
        <p>- He looked at the legal documents regarding the easement and he did 
          not understand it.</p>
        <p>- This project will be a hope that a family can live in.</p>
        <p>- It is not right to limit a person to provide space to live in instead 
          of living in boxes.</p>
        <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project per staff

          of Permit Application No. 2004.09.01.3170, proposing to construct rear 
          additions to the existing single-family dwelling at the first and third 
          levels. The ground floor rear addition would extend the rear building 
          wall approximately six feet and the third floor rear addition would 
          extend the third level rear building wall approximately 13 feet 6 inches. 
          Both additions would be set back three feet from the north side property 
          line in an RH-1(D) (Single-family Residential, Detached) District and 
          a 40-X Height and Bulk District.</p>
        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve 
          as proposed.</p>
        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>
        <p><b>(-) Jeremy Paul - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>
        <p>- He does not agree with staff's report.</p>
        <p>- The proposal is not code compliant and requires multiple variances.</p>
        <p>- The site conditions are not discussed in the project report.</p>
        <p>- Lot coverage is made irrelevant; therefore, plans are inaccurate 
          and misleading.</p>
        <p><b>(-) Sara Estroquen</b></p>
        <p>- It is an unfortunate beginning for a neighbor-to-neighbor relationship.</p>
        <p>- The proposed expansion would detract form the character of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>- The area of their home where they spend the most time is the one 
          that will be most affected by the proposed construction.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Nigel Burns - Project Sponsor</b></p>
        <p>- He wants to do a very modest project.</p>
        <p>- He would like to construct a master bath and a kitchen on the ground 
          floor.</p>
        <p>- The concerns of the Discretionary Review requestor are of air and 
          light and the suggestions by staff would decrease that impact.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Sherril Cooper Burns</b></p>
        <p>- She and her husband were delighted to find this house.</p>
        <p>- They have small children and having more space will allow them to 
          live there for many years.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- Regarding the proposed language on the construction progress requirement:  this is a dilemma the Commission always faces. </p>

        <p>- She suggested that the Commission require automatic calendaring in two years of any case that has a time limit.  Otherwise it never gets calendared and can never be revoked because it is not on the calendar. This is a frequent problem with conditional uses. </p>

        <p>- Regarding the housing needs:  She is continually troubled by the failure to break out above moderate.  </p>

        <p>- The poblem is that the Commission does not have very good information even when the sales prices information is readily available. </p>

        <p>- One can get it at the Assessor's office.  A planner can get it there as well.</p>

        <p>- Also, there should be no in lieu fee.  The in lieu fee in the code is based on things all over the city.  All of these units are going to be way high-end compared to the rest of the city. </p>

        <p><b>Chris Durazo - SOMECAN</b></p>

        <p>- She thinks that it would be wonderful to have fees for luxury units.</p>

        <p>- People cannot go from rental housing to these luxury units.</p>

        <p>- She is concerned about the new affordable construction type.</p>

        <p>- There should be an advocate for the South of Market.  It is important to have family housing.</p>

        <p><b>Reed Diment - Rincon Hill Homeowner's Association</b></p>

        <p>- The Commission should consider Inclusionary housing in each project.  This would involve the Commission's participation and look at this project-by-project.</p>

        <p>- The money raised should be for Rincon Hill exclusively.</p>

        <p><b>Steve Vettel - Morrison and Forrester</b></p>

        <p>- Regarding the Meloroose District - it should not be the cause of the delay of this project.</p>

        <p>- The language should stay the same as currently drafted.</p>

        <p><b>Lou Blazej</b></p>

        <p>- He echoed Steve Vettel's comments.</p>

        <p>- There is a notion to amend Section 315 to function on a square footage basis at a residential level.</p>

        <p><b>Azalia Merrill</b></p>

        <p>- Laborers make about 50 percent of the median income.</p>

        <p>- She appreciates Commissioners comments regarding affordability.</p>

        <p>- She agrees with &quot;grandfathering&quot; the 375 Fremont Street project because it will provide 50 to 80% of affordability.</p>
