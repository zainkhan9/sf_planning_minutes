    <p>SPEAKER(S): None</p>

    <p>ACTION: Without hearing, item continued to May 26, 2005</p>

    <p>AYES: Alexander, Antonini, Bradford Bell, Hughes, S. Lee, W. Lee, Olague</p>

    <p>2. 2003.0869E                                      (J. NAVARRETE: (415) 558-5975)</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>88 FIFTH STREET - THE OLD U.S. MINT</u> - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration</b> - The proposed project is the rehabilitation plus seismic upgrade and addition to the United States Old Mint located at 88 Fifth Street in downtown San Francisco (Assessor's Block 3704, Lot 11).  The existing three-story plus an occupied attic 99,921-gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be retained, and the first floor courtyard enclosed in 1973 for offices would be removed,  (a deduction of 4,336 gsf), and additional circulation bridges, stairs and an elevator (addition of 2,642 gsf) would be added within the existing 4-story courtyard.  The existing attic would be expanded on the roof along the south side of the courtyard to create a museum gallery (an addition of 1,554 gsf) with a view of the city skyline to the south.  The courtyard removal and additions of bridges and roof gallery would result in an overall reduction of gsf, for a total floor area of 99,788 gsf.  The building would include 79,957 square feet if usable space total including: 36,326 sf of City History Museum space, 2,082 sf of Museum office space, 2,045 sf of museum back of house space, 2,044 sf of museum retail, and 3,336 sf of museum theater space.  Tenants in the building would be the 8,153 sf Gold Rush and Money Museum, 2,492 sf of small retail lease spaces, and 6,360 gsf of restaurant space and cafe. 3,987 sf would be used for the San Francisco Visitor Center, and the remaining 11,108 sf would be circulation, toilets and support spaces ancillary to the museum use.  The project would include closure of Jessie Street to vehicles, between Mint and Fifth Streets, to be used for outdoor restaurant seating.  The project site is approximately 47,515 sq. ft., is zoned P (Public) within a 90-X height and bulk district, and within the Mid-Market St. Revitalization and Conservation District.  Transaction document approvals would be required from the Board of Supervisors, and a Certificate of Appropriateness would be required by the Landmarks Preservation Advisory Board.</p>

    <p>4.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Bicycle Coalition</i></p>

        <p>- She thanked the Bicycle Coalition for the &quot;Bike to Work Day&quot; and providing her with a bike for the day.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Home Depot</i></p>

        <p>- She is concerned when staff is accused of not doing things diligently.</p>

        <p>- She checked on the status of this and found out that Home Depot was delayed in providing information to staff.</p>

        <p>- Planning staff is on the case.  She realizes that it has been about two years </p>

        <p><i>Re:  Deliberation Between Commissioners</i></p>

        <p>- She received some phone calls about the Commissioners passing notes to each other so she asked the Commission Secretary what the procedure would be if they needed to take a break.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Commission Secretary responded:</b></p>

              <p>- It is accepted that commissioners let the President know if they need to take a break, but she cautioned Commissioners to be aware of perceptions-because the public doesn't know what's in a note--and, to the extent possible, minimize the note passing.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>5. Director's Announcements</p>

    <p>6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>BOS - </b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  18<sup>th</sup> and Alabama - Zoning Map Amendments and Code Amendments</i></p>

        <p>- Supervisor Daly requested that the ordinance be sent back to Land Use Committee with respect to affordability issues for the 23 percent of the project that would not be income restricted.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Castro Street Entertainment Exemption from Conditional Use</i></p>

        <p>- This was passed +11-0 on first reading.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  The Medical Cannabis Dispensaries</i></p>

        <p>- There was a six month extension of the moratorium but it was heard last week and it was only for 60 days.  He and others argued that in fact a proposal could be done in 60 days but it would not be before the Board for adoption because it would have to come back to Land Use for amendments and go before the Commission.  In reality, it would have to be extended for another 60 days.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  2506 Union Street</i></p>

        <p>- The Commission reviewed this and took Discretionary Review.</p>

        <p>- This was appealed with a categorical exemption and rear yard modifications.</p>

        <p>- This was upheld.</p>

        <p><b>Land Use Committee</b></p>

        <p>- There were hearings for various fee proposals for Rincon Hill.</p>

        <p><b>Marshall Foster reported:</b></p>

        <p>- Yesterday there was a Land Use Committee that only looked at the fees for Rincon Hill.</p>

        <p>- The $11.00 (local infrastructure fee) was well received.   </p>

        <p>- Other types of services were brought up at this meeting like fire, police, citywide services, etc.  These services would have to be increased.</p>

        <p>- The new property tax that would be generated from Rincon Hill was also discussed.</p>

        <p>- There was a specific request to do a specific analysis of what the needs will be for additional services in the district and what the Department sees in terms of fees and transfer tax revenue to meet those needs.</p>

        <p>- There was discussion on the Commission's resolution making recommendations to the Board.  Supervisor Sandoval specifically proposed a $3.00 citywide fee to deal with things such as parks, street and transit improvements.</p>

        <p>- There was discussion on an additional housing fee and whether it would be south of market or citywide.  This would be something the full Board would discuss.</p>

        <p>- Working with the Mayor's Office of Housing, an economic consulting firm (Economic and Planning Systems) made a presentation to the Land Use Committee on what the potential would be for additional fees.  They made an analysis and this information will be provided to the Commission next week.</p>

        <p><b>BOA - </b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- This was before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.  This was a categorical exception appeal for a 600 square foot addition.</p>

        <p>- The Commission deadlocked on a Discretionary Review vote of +3-3.  Since there wasn't a continuance the project was deemed approved.  </p>

        <p>- An appeal of the Commission's decision was filed with the Board of Appeals and then a categorical exception was filed and heard on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>- The appellant mentioned that the mid block open space was historic in nature in that it had been subdivided all at one time.  The Board upheld the Commission's determination +7-3; Supervisor Daly was absent and Supervisors Amiano, McGoldrick and Mirkarimi voted No.</p>

        <p>- The BOA heard the item and upheld the permit +4-1; Commissioner Saunders dissenting.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  1921 Webster Street</i></p>

        <p>- This came before the Commission with concerns about property line windows.  The BOA upheld the Commission's decision +3-1; Commissioner Sugaya dissenting.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Sutro Tower</i></p>

        <p>- He had issued a determination that no Conditional Use was required--that is why the Commission heard a Discretionary Review last week.</p>

        <p>- This determination was appealed and it was upheld +4-0.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  4726 Geary Boulevard</i></p>

        <p>- A determination he made regarding a violation on a massage and acupuncture use that exceeded the allowed size for an accessory massage use was a front for inappropriate activities.  The Board did not uphold this, released the suspension, required that they maintain the rules for accessory massage use, etc.</p>

        <p>- The applicant recently hired an acupuncturist that is on call.</p>

        <p>- The Police Department and the Health Department are working together to fight locations that are more for prostitution.</p>

This presentation will be an <b>informational presentation </b>to the Planning Commission by members of the Taskforce on their recently released report, specifically their suggestions for land use controls.</p>

        <p><i>Presenters:</i></p>

        <p><b>Karin Woods - Mission Bay Development/Mission Bay Citizen's Advisory Committee/USF Community Advisory Group</b></p>

        <p>- She was asked to be a member of the bioscience task force, which was empowered by the Board of Supervisors to analyze the land use and zoning recommendations for the possibility of using bioscience resources outside Mission Bay and Hunter's Point.</p>

        <p>- They discovered during the one and a half year study that it is important to know what the community needs and what the industry needs.</p>

        <p><b>Scott Williams - MBBG Architecture/Design/Planning</b></p>

        <p>- They do a lot of work in the bioscience industry.</p>

        <p>- What the industry needs is basically building permits.</p>

        <p>- In order to have bioscience, one needs buildings.</p>

        <p>- The patent time frames are extremely crucial.</p>

        <p>- The difference between success and failure could be a few months.</p>

        <p>- Bioscience truly brings a mixed use.</p>

        <p>- Usually the process follows this order:  1) Research; 2) development; 3) pharmaceutical operations (also known as manufacturing) and 4) marketing operations.</p>

        <p>- Planning helped them with defining PDR and they used it as a template to do their research.</p>

        <p>- There are many types of uses in bioscience.  For example, there are offices for laboratory use, which are separate from administrative offices.</p>

        <p>- There is need for chillers and boilers, outdoor and indoor, and many of these items cause a lot of noise.</p>

        <p><b>Peter Cohen</b></p>

        <p>- He is a member of the task force and he is involved mostly in community perspectives.</p>

        <p>- Bioscience also needs to be weighed in with the uses in the Eastern Neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- There are many questions to ask regarding zoning controls and policy perspectives.</p>

        <p>- The land use recommendations received input from many communities and committees.</p>

        <p><b>Lori Yamaguchi - Assistant Vice Chancellor for Campus Planning for UCSF</b></p>

        <p>- The recommendations they determined involves various areas that include, for example, safety, size, etc.</p>

        <p>- Their recommendation for zoning bioscience is 1) treat bioscience as Mixed Use grouped into light, medium and core bioscience; 2) use &quot;overlay zones&quot; as land use framework to allow bioscience in industrial PDR areas; 3) two overlay zones of PDR sizes recommended:  Zone 1 - areas immediately close to Mission Bay and Hunter's Point Shipyard, Zone 2 - areas to the North and West of Zone 1 areas; 4) BSL 1 and BSL 2 without buffer from residential districts; 5) BSL 3 labs be separated by a 50 foot buffer from residential districts; 6) No BSL 4.</p>

        <p>- She displayed a map of the BSL zones.</p>

        <p>- Other issues include: economic development and job training; etc.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><b>Francisco DeCosta</b></p>

        <p>- He is very interested in this bioscience technology.</p>

        <p>- Something to take into consideration is to study the history of Mission Bay.</p>

        <p>- There is also concern for the type of soils in the area.</p>

        <p>- Even though protocols have not been discussed in detail, there should be emergency protocols in place.</p>

        <p>- There are residents living close by.</p>

        <p>- It is not sufficient to offer jobs without considering quality of life standards.</p>

        <p><b>Joe Boss</b></p>

        <p>- He is happy that the task force was formed thanks to Supervisor Maxwell.</p>

        <p>- As the City embarks on this, he does not want to see a &quot;train wreck&quot; created by saying that a 50-foot separation is good enough.</p>

        <p>- The City does not need more task forces or committees to investigate things.</p>

        <p>- He would like to see more language on separation.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>D. GENERAL</b> <b>PUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES</b></p>

    <p><b>Julian Lagos</b></p>

    <p><i>Re:  800 Brotherhood Way</i></p>

    <p>- He is opposed to this project.  The developer has not put out any notices to the neighbors.</p>

    <p>- He hopes that the Commission will at least continue this project for 30 to 60 days until the neighbors are notified.</p>

    <p>- He is concerned about gentrification, seismic stability and that the area will be in danger with this type of project.</p>

    <p><b>Joe Morales - Tenant's Union, Senior Action Network, MAC</b></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Park Merced</i></p>

    <p>- This area should not be gentrified but protected.</p>

        <p>- He was worked as an inspector for the Building Inspection Department.</p>

        <p>- If he were inspecting the property, he would have to suggest to the owner to legalize a unit or to revert back to single family dwelling.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Cristine Bruskey</b></p>

        <p>- She is concerned with the Commission's way of dealing with mergers because it [the Commission's actions] is not promoting family environments.</p>

    <p><b>(-) Lou Blazej - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

    <p>- There is a pattern to the houses on the street where this project is proposed.</p>

    <p>- This pattern should be maintained and protected.</p>

    <p>- It is an inappropriate proposal.  He hopes the Commission will deny this application.</p>

    <p><b>(-) Bernard Smith - Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- If this large, obtrusive structure is allowed, he will loose light and air coming to his house.</p>

        <p>- He understands the need for improving the quality of life of your children, but the previous owner raised four children there.</p>

        <p>- The proposal should be neighbor friendly and it is not. </p>

        <p><b>(-) Josephine Smith</b></p>

        <p>- She objects to this rear addition.</p>

        <p>- She and her husband have lived in their home for 33 years.</p>

        <p>- All of the houses in the area have three bedrooms only.</p>

        <p>- She and her husband raised children in their house with the size that it is now.</p>

        <p>- If this project should be approved, she asks for a four-foot setback.  This will allow sunshine and air to their home.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Julia Birmingham</b></p>

        <p>- There are a few houses on the block that already have diminished light and air and one of them is her parents house.</p>

        <p>- The proposal would cause a tunnel affect on her parent's home.</p>

        <p>- She requested that the Commission not allow this proposal to go forward.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Teresa Going</b></p>

        <p>- She objects to the rear expansion.  It will strongly affect the quality of her parent's home.</p>

        <p>- Her mom really enjoys putting the clothes out on the line and she enjoys the sunshine.</p>

        <p>- This extension would hurt the character and style of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Ann Marie Smith</b></p>

        <p>- The proposed extension would affect the livability of her parents.</p>

        <p>- The proposal would also be incompatible with the character of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Grace Shanahan</b></p>

        <p>- This proposal would not allow for the current mid block open space.</p>

        <p>- The mid block open space also allows for light to come in to kitchens in the homes on the block.</p>

        <p>- Prices are not the only singular reason that stops people from living in San Francisco; it is also the quality of life.</p>

        <p>- The pattern of the mid block open space will be destroyed if this proposal is approved.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Angus McCarthy</b></p>

        <p>- He does not know the Discretionary Review requestor but he is working on a project similar to theirs.  Even though the guidelines allow you to build in a certain way, there should be respect for the existing conditions.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will revise this plan or deny it all together.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Oliver McCabe</b></p>

        <p>- He is a retired building inspector.</p>

        <p>- This proposal will affect the quality of life for the Discretionary Review requestor.</p>

        <p>- The DR requestor has a very small yard and the proposed addition will completely block their light and air.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Diane O'Malley</b></p>

        <p>- She lives in the area.</p>

        <p>- It is important to protect open spaces.  She came from Manhattan so she values open spaces.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Joe O'Donaghue</b></p>

        <p>- This block has remained unaltered for many years.</p>

        <p>- If this addition is allowed, it will invade the privacy of all neighbors.</p>

        <p>- Price is not just the only thing; it is the quality of life that is important as well.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Steve Williams</b></p>

        <p>- He agrees with the planner's recommendation to modify this project.</p>

        <p>- It is important to maintain historical continuity in neighborhoods.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Mark English - Project Architect</b></p>

        <p>- He has been working with the project sponsor for about a year now on this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Ron Miguel</b></p>

        <p>- He reviewed the changes made by the architect and he supports this project.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><b>(+) Beverly Spector</b></p>

    <p>- She purchased the home many years ago and now they have two children.</p>

    <p>- They spoke to their neighbors about the proposed project.</p>

    <p>- They do not want to harm anyone but the neighbors did not want to speak to her.</p>

    <p>- She agrees with the modifications to the project.</p>

    <p><b>(+) Kenneth Lipson</b></p>

    <p>- He feels that he should enjoy his property rights and their project should be allowed.</p>

    <p>- This addition is not intrusive and it is an impressive design scheme.</p>

    <p>- The revised design respects the neighborhood character.</p>

    <p>- Many petitioners who signed opposing the project did not know what they were signing.</p>

        <ul><ul><p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved with the following modifications:  1) align the depth of the rear wall of the first floor with the rear wall of the Discretionary Review requestor's building; 2) allow for a two foot bay; 3) the southern wall of the ground floor remains as shown in drawing 51105; 4) the ground floor north wall should have a side set back of three feet from property line; 5) back stairs relocated to the south wall of the ground floor; 6) the existing 11 foot high wall should be reduced to 6 feet; 7) three foot setbacks on both sides of second floor; 8) elimination of three foot section of the walk in closet which extends the light well (light well would therefore be 9x6); 9) deck is still with the restriction on decking on the north side and open railing.</p>

        <p>- The demolition consists of two existing structures.</p>

        <p>- There has been concern about the safety of this structure since the roof has already collapsed.</p>

        <p>- The structure has been vacant for two years.</p>

        <p>- The property has been deemed non-conforming and non-compatible.</p>

        <p>- The new structure will consist of three units, which will be very large.</p>

        <p>- It will allow for maximum light and air.</p>

        <p>- The project will contain a height setback to lessen the impact of the height of the structure.</p>

        <p>- Through communication with the neighbors, the project has been revised to deal with their issues.</p>

        <p>- The windows will be soundproofed because there is a neighbor that owns a bar nearby.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Nick Pagalagos - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition</b></p>

        <p>- The soundness of this structure is at issue.  The building was occupied for many years.</p>

        <p>- Supervisor Matt Gonzales lived there for many years and he stated that the building was fine.</p>

        <p>- The soundness of the structure was compromised with the gutting of the structure and perhaps it was gutted on purpose.</p>

        <p>- The Commission should not reward the project sponsor.  He did not take out the necessary permits.</p>

        <p>- The new building will not have affordable units.</p>

        <p>- He knows that the project sponsor did things that should not have happened.</p>

        <p>- She inspected both buildings more than once and both are in a state of severe decay.</p>

        <p>- They were in a state of severe decay even before they were gutted.</p>

        <p>- The building would need a tremendous amount of repairs.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- There are various permits that were taken out previously.</p>

        <p>- The new housing will not be family housing.</p>

        <p>- Initially the group made up a story that the proposed site was a site of a historical school.</p>

        <p>- The truth of the matter is that the IBNA's involvement is just because they are opposed to any type of housing.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>800 BROTHERHOOD WAY (A.K.A. 3711 19<sup>TH</sup> AVENUE)</u> - <b>Appeal of Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration</b> - The proposed project is the construction of up to 182 dwelling units on an approximately 7.7 acre undeveloped site located on the north side of Brotherhood Way, west of Chumasero Drive, east of Lake Merced Boulevard.  The project would involve subdividing the site into about 121 lots and constructing 60 single-family homes and 61 2-unit dwellings.  The 121 buildings would be between 3 and 4 stories tall, with heights up to 40 feet and would total about 444,273 gross square feet.  A mix of independently accessible and tandem parking spaces would be provided, for a total of 364 off-street parking spaces.  Twenty-one on-street parking spaces would also be created along a new two-way internal private loop road.  Access to the site would be via a new driveway on the unimproved portion of the north side of Brotherhood Way abutting the site.  There would be a traffic signal at the new access driveway and Brotherhood Way intersection that would be interconnected with the existing signals at Brotherhood Way/School (Church) Access Road, located about 330 feet to the west, and the Chumasero Drive/Brotherhood Way intersection, about 560 feet to the east.  The project site is located in an RM-1 (Mixed Residential, Low Density) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would require approval of a Conditional Use Authorization for a Planned Unit Development and exceptions for minimum lot sizes, minimum rear yards depths, and bay window dimension.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>(-) Adena Rosmarin - 1<sup>st</sup> Appellant - Lakeshore Acres Improvement Club</b></p>

        <p>- The Planning Department has used the wrong &quot;ruler&quot; to measure the impacts on this project.</p>

        <p>- Planning has used the uses to the north as a base for their findings on this report when they should be based on both north and south.</p>

        <p>- There is inaccurate data in the report.</p>

        <p>- Regarding the biological assessment, Planning has failed to do a thorough analysis because their investigation only covers one season when certain species are migrating.</p>

        <p>- The information and determination from Planning is invalid.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Armand Kilijian - 2<sup>nd</sup> Appellant - St. Gregory Armenian Apostolic Church</b></p>

        <p>- He does not agree with staff's report or response.</p>

        <p>- The area has a variety of ethnic and religious communities.</p>

        <p>- Traffic along the corridor is growing rapidly.</p>

        <p>- There are five different schools in the area.</p>

        <p>- The proposed housing development would hinder the growth of these schools.</p>

        <p>- No one has received a straight answer on why the entrance to the housing unit has to be on Brotherhood Way instead of Park Merced Boulevard.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Ollia Yanikomshian - 3<sup>rd</sup> Appellant - K.Z.V. Armenian School</b></p>

        <p>- She represents parents who are opposed to this development.</p>

        <p>- Brotherhood Way has been a combination of schools and churches.</p>

        <p>- The increase in traffic would be tremendous.</p>

        <p>- The community has issues of safety and traffic.</p>

        <p><b>(-)Marie Brooks - 4<sup>th</sup> Appellant - Lake Merced Church of Christ</b></p>

        <p>- There are beautiful trees on the streets where the project is proposed.</p>

        <p>- The area was never meant for housing.</p>

        <p>- The area still feels like open space and country surroundings.</p>

        <p>- The increase in traffic would create a hazard for the children attending the schools in the area.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Andrew Thanos - Holy Trinity Greek Orthodox Church (Parish Council)</b></p>

        <p>- He understands that Park Merced is selling the property with the condition that the new structure should have the entrance on Brotherhood Way.</p>

        <p>- This would impact the area tremendously.</p>

        <p>- One solution would be to reduce the density of the project.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Lynn Lynch - Preserve Our Neighborhood</b></p>

        <p>- There are inaccuracies with the information provided by the developer.</p>

        <p>- This was a similar situation when the Stonestown project was done.</p>

        <p>- An EIR should be written because it needs a thorough analysis.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Ron Miguel - HAC</b></p>

        <p>- He has looked at the answers the Department has provided.</p>

        <p>- The negative declaration is accurate.</p>

        <p>- He is very informed about this area.</p>

        <p>- The area is a highway link to various areas of San Francisco.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Robert Pender - Vice President - Park Merced Residents</b></p>

        <p>- He has lived in the area for many years.</p>

        <p>- The area is a haven for housing because of its beauty.</p>

        <p>- There were about four other people here in support of the project but they had to leave.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Bert Polacci - Carmel Partners</b></p>

        <p>- The proposed project would benefit the area because it will be a connection to various amenities.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this proposal.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Father Michael Pappas</b></p>

        <p>- At one point, it was decided that the corridor should be reserved for religious institutions.</p>

        <p>- The proposed project would be a violation of the spirit of these religious institutions.</p>

        <p>- The project would increase vehicular traffic that would be dangerous to the children who attend the schools.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Steve Vettel - Morrison and Forrester - Representing Project Applicant</b></p>

        <p>- The document addresses all the issues that have been raised today.</p>

        <p>- The area is not park land and it has never been park land.</p>

        <p>- Regarding traffic: there was a lot of time spent determining where the entrance and exits would be located.  The negative declaration specifies that where the driveway is located is the best place.</p>

        <p>- There is no evidence of any endangered species using the area as their habitat.</p>

        <p>- All trees that need to be removed will be replaced.</p>

        <p><b>(+) J.C. Wallace</b></p>

        <p>- He is a resident and homeowner of Lakeshore Acres</p>

        <p>- He takes his children to play near the lake.</p>

        <p>- The project will be very well designed and appropriate for the site.</p>

        <p>- There is a need for housing in the area.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p>- He lives in the West Portal area.</p>

        <p>- He supports the project.</p>

        <p>- The lake is a significant environmental resource for migratory birds.  All the work being done in the area has not been harmful for these birds.</p>

        <p>- This is a well planned, well designed project that provides desperately needed housing.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Kate White - San Francisco Housing Action Coalition</b></p>

        <p>- They strongly support the housing.</p>

        <p>- There have been a number of great improvements based on the neighbor's issues.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Ron Miguel - Housing Action Coalition</b></p>

        <p>- The south side of the area has always had religious institutions.</p>

        <p>- He lives in the area.</p>

        <p>- He is not an advocate for housing that has a lot of parking but this project is different.</p>

        <p>- The project is family housing.</p>

        <p>- His children are grown and they cannot afford to buy a home in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- This project would allow young adults to remain in the city and raise families.</p>

        <p>- The only thing he recommends is that the crosswalks and sidewalks are created for safety of the residents.</p>

        <p><b>(+/-) Armand Kilijian - St. Gregory Armenian Apostolic Church</b></p>

        <p>- If there will be family housing in the area, then the project should have a place for children to play.</p>

        <p>- He is afraid that if this is not done, the children will come to play on their property, which would not be bad, but there is a liability issue.</p>

        <p>- The crosswalks should be improved so that they are not a hazard to the residents.</p>

        <p>- The whole picture needs to be evaluated, not just the three traffic lights.</p>

        <p>- If this is going to go through it should be a great project not just a good one.</p>

        <p><b>(-) did not state name</b></p>

        <p>- There are certain issues to this project that just don't click regarding the square footage.</p>

        <p>- He is not saying no to housing.</p>

        <p>- A variance needs to be discussed as well.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Steve Riter - Mission Valley Properties</b></p>

        <p>- When there is dialogue with the residents, a better project is created.</p>

        <p>- They have had many dialogues with the residents and have heard all the issues.</p>

        <p>- He has gone over and above the CEQA requirements.</p>

        <p>- A majority of the institutions are in support of the project even though they were not able to convince everyone.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Steve Vettel</b></p>

        <p>- Regarding the density issue:  the zoning allows for density.</p>

        <p>- Regarding the traffic issue:  there will not be any changes to the current levels of service to the intersections.</p>

        <p>- A new intersection will be created and the impacts of the project will only be at this intersection.</p>

        <p>- The morning peak impacts are because of the drop off of the school children.</p>

    <p><b>Eileen Boken - SPEAK</b></p>

    <p>- She requested a rehearing of this project.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Disconnection between the Planning Department and the Board of Appeals.</i></p>

    <p>- She asked the Board of Appeals staff what percentages of [Commission] determinations were overturned by the Board.  She received the information that 60 to 80 percent were overturned.</p>

    <p>- This is in part due to project sponsor and their legal councils believing that they can act with impunity at the Board of Appeals and malign not only the Planning Commission but also members of the public.</p>

    <p>- She received negative criticism at the Board of Appeals as well.</p>

    <p>- The organization she belongs to does not have any interest in acquiring the property.  She is only interested in this property to designate it historically significant.</p>
