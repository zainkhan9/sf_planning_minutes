be added to floors 2+17 on the north and west sides of the L-shaped building, and above
the roof (but not above the existing parapet),  for a total of approximately 257,700 sq.ft. in
building area. Two new floors would be created where existing floors with high ceilings

architectural character. The project requires approval under Section 309 for Permit Review
in C-3 District and a Permit to Alter for major alterations to a Category I building identified
in Article 11 of the City Planning Code.   It would also require a conditional use authorization

identified areas and made alterations as needed.  These amended maps will be available
for public review at the Planning Department, 1660 Mission Street, 5th floor.  The review
