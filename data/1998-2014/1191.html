          Preliminary Negative Declaration</b> - The proposed project would include 
          demolition of an existing 4,344 gross-square-foot, one-story retail/commercial 
          building and rear storage building and construction of a five-story, 
          50-foot-tall mixed-use building which would contain 32 residential units 
          on the second through fifth floors and retail/commercial use on the 
          ground floor. The residential use would be 27,491 gross square feet 
          (gsf) in area, and the retail/commercial space would be 4,344 gsf in 
          size. The ground floor and basement levels would include 32 parking 
          spaces designated for the residential use with ingress and egress from 
          South Van Ness Avenue. The ground floor would contain the commercial 
          space and residential lobby. The 12,253-square-foot site is located 
          within the C-M (Heavy Commercial) zoning district and within a 50-X 
          height and bulk district. The proposed project requires a conditional

      <ul>
        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Article in the Newspaper</i></p>
        <p>- The article raised a very interesting question 
          about 88 Townsend.</p>
        <p>- How much of a building should be preserve and 
          how should an adjacent property be treated?</p>
        <p>- This is a very good question.</p>
        <p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Fire Code</i></p>
        <p>- He asked what the status is of an ordinance regarding 
          the fire code.</p>
        <p>- When does the ordinance go into effect because 
          it will affect projects that the department is currently approving?</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b><i>Zoning Administrator responded:</i></b></p>
          <p>- He discussed this issue with the Building Department 
            and was told that it is an adopted ordinance and it is being implemented 
            right now.</p>
          <p>- The title of the ordinance states: Self-contained 
            breathing replenishment systems on high rises where permits had been 
            issued after March 30, 2004.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>
        <p>- During the permit process, when is one required 
          to meet the fire code?</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b><i>Zoning Administrator responded:</i></b></p>
          <p>- The application should have been submitted after 
            March 30, 2004.</p>
          <p><b><i>Interim Director Macris responded:</i></b></p>
          <p>- There will be a coordination meeting with DBI 
            next Thursday so they will raise this question and report to the Commission 
            afterward.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Density Bonuses</i></p>
        <p>- If one builds for low income or very low income 
          are there higher density bonuses?</p>
        <p>- He would like to receive information on this.</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b><i>Interim Director Macris responded:</i></b></p>
          <p>- He is inquiring with the City Attorney on the 
            recently acquired state law.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>
        <p>- When this issue was before the Commission she 
          had some concerns about PDR matters and she knows that these concerns 
          are being address in a report being prepared.</p>
        <p>- She is concerned that projects are being delayed 
          or that the viewpoint of Commissioners are not being considered.</p>
        <p>- The Commission gave comments and direction on 
          what they wanted and what their concerns are. She feels that some of 
          the concerns are not being addressed or the information is not getting 
          a back to the Commission.</p>
        <p>- The Commission's opinions should be respected 
          and both Commission and staff should work together.</p>
        <ul>
          <p><b>Interim Director Macris responded:</b></p>
          <p>- Staff is trying to respond to all the questions 
            and concerns that the Commission has.</p>
          <p>- He welcomed Commissioner Bell to come to the 
            department for a briefing on the status of projects.</p>
          <p>- It would be useful that on more than one occasion, 
            any member of the Commission can speak with him a few minutes before 
            the meeting starts to be briefed on any issue they would like to speak 
            on.</p>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Commissioner Hughes:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Planning Director Search</i></p>
        <p>- He reminded staff to submit their questions regarding 
          the hiring of the new director.</p>
        <p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>
        <p>Re: Housing Element and Emporium/Capwell</p>
        <p>- She wants to know what the status of these issues 
          are.</p>
        <p><b>Commissioner W. Lee:</b></p>
        <p><i>Re: Performance of the Commission</i></p>
        <p>- He requested that Interim Director Macris send 
          to staff a questionnaire on how they feel the Commission has been working 
          so far and any issue that might be of interest to them regarding the 
          performance of the Commission.</p>
        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>
        <p>- He agrees with Commissioner W. Lee and encouraged 
          staff to do that.</p>
        <p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>
        <p>- She feels the same way as Commissioner W. Lee 
          and Antonini.</p>
        <p>- It is important to work together and communicate.</p>

    <p><b>John McMahan</b></p>
    <p><i>Re: Newspaper Article</i></p>
    <p>- He has lived in San Francisco for many years.</p>
    <p>- He read an article from John King of the San Francisco 
      Chronicle called &quot;Insulting Historic Preservation&quot; related to 
      a trend called &quot;facadism&quot; where, in the quest to hold on to the 
      past, parts of the existing building is retained and a new contraction is 
      done behind it.</p>
    <p><b>Jim Salinas</b></p>
    <p><i>Re: Affordable Housing</i></p>
    <p>- He is concerned about the current situation at the 
      Commission.</p>
    <p>- He feels very strongly that the Commission has done 
      positive things for San Francisco.</p>
    <p>- The greatest responsibility that the Commission has 
      right now is to create housing.</p>
    <p>- All of the objectives and goals can be achieved.</p>
    <p><b>Azalia Merrill</b></p>
    <p><i>Re: Affordable Housing</i></p>
    <p>- She grows weary of San Franciscans being forced out 
      of the City. There is no housing crisis. There is an affordable housing 
      crisis.</p>
    <p>- There are truly remarkable buildings in San Francisco 
      that could be preserved.</p>
    <p>- The Commission should look at buildings that could 
      provide affordable housing.</p>
    <p><b>Marilyn Amini</b></p>
    <p><i>Re: Items on the Calendar</i></p>
    <p>- There are two items on the calendar that involve planning 
      code amendments.</p>
    <p>- Both of these items should have an intent to initiate. 
      The community needs to be advised and the public available to comment.</p>
    <p>- The current procedures in the administrative code 
      have no provisions for general rule exclusion assignments.</p>
  </ul>
  <p><b>E. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC 
    HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED</b></p>
  <ul>
    <p>At this time, members of the public who wish to address 
      the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public 
      hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public 
      hearing has been closed, must do so at this time. Each member of the public 
      may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>
    <p><i>Re: 1517 Irving Street</i></p>
    <p><b>Jeremy Paul</b></p>
    <p>- He is looking forward to hearing the demolition policy.</p>
    <p>- He attempted to reach the neighbors involved in this 
      case but was unsuccessful.</p>
    <p>- As much housing as possible on this site should be 
      allowed.</p>
    <p>- He encourages the Commission to support a new building 
      at this site.</p>
    <p><b>Pat Buscovich</b></p>
    <p>- Staff believes that mold should not be included in 
      a demolition evaluation.</p>
    <p>- There was a fire in the building a few years ago.</p>
    <p>- Instead of taking out the walls, particleboards was 
      glued to the walls. When these particleboards were removed, there were extreme 
      levels of mold.</p>
    <p>- The mold at this house will affect the quality of 
      living.</p>
    <p><b>Gabriel Ng - Project Architect</b></p>
    <p>- He presented a shadow study to the neighbors.</p>
    <p>- He displayed a sketch of the proposed new construction.</p>
    <p>- He has tried to keep everyone involved in this project 
      happy.</p>
    <p><i>Re: 605 Kearny Street</i></p>
    <p><b>Erin Crucz - S. F. Architectural Heritage</b></p>
    <p><b>- </b>She was concerned with the height, the setback, 
      floor plates, etc.</p>
    <p>- They have meet with the project sponsor twice and 
      were very pleased with the outcome of the meetings.</p>
    <p>- There has been a new proposal that should eliminate 
      a setback.</p>
    <p>- She asked the Commission to approve the proposal that 
      includes the setback and the masonry stucco materials.</p>
    <p><i>Re: 1234 Howard Street</i></p>
    <p><b>Cesar Moreno - San Francisco Housing Action Coalition</b></p>
    <p>- The Housing Coalition endorses this site because it 
      will provide much needed housing.</p>
    <p>- The project also provides a very sensitive way to 
      complement the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
    <p>- He submitted a letter of endorsement regarding the

          the Planning Commission's current &quot;Temporary Policy&quot; for Mandatory 
          Discretionary Review of Dwellings proposed for demolition, and the criteria 
          it comprises, a discussion of the efficacy and effects of the policy, 
          and preliminary recommendations for revised elements to be adopted in 
          the future as a long term policy, following a two-month period of review 
          and public comment.</p>
        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Informational presentation 
          - no action to be taken</p>
        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>
        <p><b>(+) Pat Buscovich</b></p>
        <p>- He made some comments and submitted them to the 
          Commission regarding this being a good idea to have Discretionary Reviews 
          that involve demolitions and new constructions.</p>
        <p>- The different type of projects should be very 
          distinct.</p>
        <p>- It is very important for the Commission to exercise 
          their discretion on the quality of the house.</p>
        <p>- There are two different types of mold. Sometimes 
          there is mold because of defective construction.</p>
        <p>- Retaining walls should be included since they 
          are part of the building.</p>
        <p>- There should be a demolition impact fee because 
          there are developers that are demolishing houses and replacing them 
          with giant houses.</p>
        <p>- Staff should hire him as the consultant instead 
          of individual project applicants.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Jeremy Paul</b></p>
        <p>- It is important for the Commission to study what 
          this policy has done to the process.</p>
        <p>- He does not like it when clients come to him masquerading 
          projects.</p>
        <p>- The impact on the housing stock is not a good 
          one.</p>
        <p>- He congratulated staff on their work, but there 
          are still some items that need to be analyzed.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Jim Salinas</b></p>
        <p>- He commended staff for this sound and solid report.</p>
        <p>- Many demolitions were approved previously.</p>
        <p>- He has seen soundness reports that are not very 
          reliable.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Azalea Merrill</b></p>
        <p>- There should be safeguards that will state when 
          or how a particular house should be demolished.</p>
        <p>- The Commission should keep hold of affordable 
          housing.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Sue Hestor</b></p>
        <p>- She could tell from the demolition report if there 
          will be a lot of problems</p>
        <p>- Eliminating the engineers/contractors that are 
          being hired by developers is a good idea.</p>
        <p>- There are many projects that are overturned at 
          the Board of Appeals.</p>
        <p>- The Board of Appeals should not undermine the 
          policy.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Alice Barkley</b></p>
        <p>- The Board of Appeal has on staff two architects 
          so the Board itself has its on expertise for evaluating buildings and 
          reports related to demolition.</p>
        <p>- There are problems with the policy: it doesn't 
          address facades. If the facade of a certain building is ugly and the 
          project sponsor wants it replaced.</p>
        <p>- Older buildings should have the garage level raised.</p>
        <p>- There are various items that still need to be 
          looked at related to defacto demolitions.</p>
        <p>- In the new policy there should be some leeway 
          to look at these types of projects carefully.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Joe Butler</b></p>
        <p>- The City's smallest houses are the most vulnerable.</p>
        <p>- People with low or moderate incomes should be 
          allowed to bid on small homes.</p>
        <p>- Promises are made to the Commission that are never 
          set forward.</p>
        <p>ACTION: Informational only. No Action Required by 
          the Commission</p>

        <p>- They are concerned that with an increased number 
          of children, the playground area would be noisier. They would appreciate 
          it if the project sponsor would find a way to reduce the noise.</p>
        <p>- There is a parking issue in the area already.

        <p><b>(-) Steve Currier - Outer Mission Residents Association 
          - Representing Discretionary Review Requestor</b></p>
        <p>- The project will block a window of an adjacent 
          neighbor.</p>
        <p>- This would greatly compromise the light and air 
          to that neighbor.</p>
        <p>- They met with the owner to try to come to a compromise 
          but there was no agreement.</p>
        <p>- They are willing and able to try to modify the 
          project by eliminating the third floor.</p>
        <p><b>(-) Gwendolyn Giblin</b></p>
        <p>- Her house will be affected by the construction.</p>
        <p>- Staff has come to a reasonable recommendation. 
          The only issue here is the third floor.</p>
        <p><b>(-) Mary Tam</b></p>
        <p>- She is concerned with the impact the project will 
          have on her light and air.</p>
        <p>- Her mother does her early morning prayers in an 
          area that is very sunny and this would impact her.</p>
        <p>- She does not oppose the construction, just the 
          third level.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Peter Pham - Representing Project Sponsor</b></p>
        <p>- It is crucial for the project sponsor to add a 
          bathroom as it has been designed.</p>
        <p>- Any modification would affect the neighbors yet 
          the neighbors concerns do not rise to any extraordinary impacts.</p>
        <p>- The neighbor's house is blocked by existing trees, 
          which block the views and the light.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Teresita de la Cruz</b></p>
        <p>- She and her husband have spent most of their lives 
          working and living in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>- Her house needs upgrades and modifications.</p>
        <p>- As she and her husband get older, it would be 
          difficult for them to climb up the stairs that is why they need to install 
          a bathroom near their bedroom.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Eleanor de la Cruz</b></p>
        <p>- Her father is planning to retire.</p>
        <p>- Having a bathroom in her parent's bedroom would 
          be a convenience to her elderly parents.</p>
        <p>- They have made various attempts to compromise 
          with the neighbors.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Mariann Sullivan</b></p>
        <p>- She does not understand why there is a view concern 
          since there are many tall trees that block the view anyway.</p>
        <p>- The building that is proposed is only 8 feet so 
          there is enough space between the houses.</p>
        <p>- There have been concerns about the open space 
          but there have been neighbors that have constructed additions. She does 
          not believe that this is a valid argument.</p>
        <p>- Many other neighbors are not opposed to the project.</p>
        <p><b>(+) Barbara Driver</b></p>
        <p>- She has lived on Winding Way since 1983.</p>
        <p>- She is a member of the Association.</p>
        <p>- She does not believe that the Association conducted 
          any voting on this project.</p>
        <p>- Many of the neighbors are not opposed to the project.</p>
        <p>- There are streets above her that can look down 
          on us and we can look down on other houses.</p>
        <p>- Some of the homes in the neighborhood have telescopes.</p>
        <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the 
          project with the following modifications: 1) remove top floor addition; 
          2) remove proposed bar sink on the second floor; 3) require the recordation

  <ul>
    <p>At this time, members of the public may address the 
      Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject 
      matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items. With respect 
      to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded 
      when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception. When the agenda 
      item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the 
      public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public 
      hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during 
      the Public Comment portion of the Calendar. Each member of the public may 
      address the Commission for up to three minutes. </p>
    <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action 
      or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those 
      items raised at public comment. In response to public comment, the commission 
      is limited to: </p>
    <p>(1) responding to statements made or questions posed 
      by members of the public; or</p>
    <p>(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a 
      subsequent meeting; or </p>
    <p>(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
