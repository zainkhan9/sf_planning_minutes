<ol>
<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We have been working on this project for about four years with the Planning Department.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The Sponsor and I am pleased to be back here today to present the project and its evolution so that maybe we can take you into the mind of the architect and the planners as we come with a proposal that you are going to see here today.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I'd like to begin first with the origins of this project and its location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> As you can see from the image on the screen where you see the label, it sits at the intersection of Market and 8<sup>th</sup> Streets and all the way to Mission Street is the current proposed site.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">For those in the audience who may not be familiar, it is on Market Street directly across from the Orpheum Building, a very well known corridor.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The site is currently occupied by the original motel building or hotel building that existed on the site, a horizontal low rise building that is largely surrounded by parking lots.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">As you can see, there is an anomaly on the site in the fact that Stevenson does not actually traverse that parcel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When the hotel was built, Stevenson must have been vacated and the parcel was consolidated all the way across.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">You will see how we respond to that unusual circumstance in the City structure.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The existing building occupies most of the length of the site along 8<sup>th.</sup></span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What you can see along the top of the page is how Stevenson actually dead-ends abruptly with no termination cul-de-sac or any other means of return.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The site receives the sun from the South and of course east and west at certain time of the day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And we just show you where the shadows are cast internally with the site.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The diagram that is now on the screen is the shadow plan that actually cuts through the site that is truly the true limiting factor, because it really dominates above the zoning heights that are permitted on the site.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It becomes really the deciding factor in the massing of the building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The shadow ordinance requires this and, as you can see, there is a high point on Mission Street that cascades gently along the corner to 8<sup>th</sup> and along Market and eventually to the low corner of Market and 8<sup>th</sup>, which becomes the lowest point of the property.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">But in fact, it's sort of coincidental, it sort of fits into the City texture and the fact that buildings along Market are above the height that the shadow ordinance provides and buildings along Mission, they are evolving; they are quite a bit taller.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So, this takes us to the actual site plan of this project and you can see what we are doing fundamentally here, we are trying to reestablish the City grid and reestablish some of the traffic patterns in a coherent way.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The axis of Stevenson is reinstated with a pedestrian promenade that takes one directly across the site.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What we are actually recreating here is the two original sites with a larger site along Market and a narrower site along Mission.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The dead end is extended along the site and makes a regular turn and exits along Mission far enough from the corner so it is a logical intersection at the termination of what Stevenson's is today, which is essentially a service drive.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Three years ago when we heard about the project that was planned to demolished at Trinity Plaza, it led to great concern among the tenants and groups like ours because we were going to lose 360 units of rent controlled housing.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In response to that threat, I asked Supervisor Chris Daly to introduce legislation to prevent the demolition citywide.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Early in December we were planning to re-circulate a special election for June 2005.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The end result was that I got a call from Jack Davis, representing Angelo Sangiacomo, who said we've been fighting so long, what if we save all your rent-controlled housing?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Well, keep in mind nowhere in the history of California, I don't believe anywhere in the history of America, has anyone built new housing under rent control.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">They might have build it under Federal, but not under rent control.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Of course, State law forbids rent control in new housing.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Angelo was suggesting that he would agree voluntarily with a deed restriction for rent control and that all housing would be replaced on site and none of our tenants in the building would be displaced because the minute the building was ready they would move right over.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In fact in a subsequent agreement negotiated by Supervisor Daly, the builders are going to pay for the move and the tenants can take all their furniture to the new place as well.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">That assurance made a big difference.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It looked like we could work out something that would be that rare opportunity for people who have been historic adversaries to come together.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">After all we've said about him [Mr. Sangiacomo], I'm willing to step forward and make peace.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If we did the 15% affordable, we would end up with 275 affordable units in this project.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Instead we are getting 350 rent controlled units.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When you say you could work out a better deal, how come no better deal has ever come?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Who could afford to build rent controlled?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Where would they get financing?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The truth is if you do not have the wealth of Angelo Sangiacomo, this project wouldn't happen.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There is no public money in this.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Trinity is giving up 200 commercial parking spaces it already has.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Remember when you take away parking spots from revenue it is already getting, that means that you are taking millions of dollars out of the project.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">On inclusionary &ndash; we could have given up rent controlled units and gotten more affordable units.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The tenants opted for more rent control rather than have more affordable units.</span></li>

<ol>
<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We have been working with Angelo Sangiacomo and the City to try to get this before you.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I get to deal with the un-sexy parts of this project, the open issues that Craig Nikitas raised and didn't close up.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I am going to try to address those in some kind of orderly fashion.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The first that comes to mind and that Randy Shaw mentioned to you is the parking issue.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Throughout the discussions with the City, this was collaboration between the City, the tenants and the project sponsor.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We were working on a development agreement throughout the project.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We had the support of the City for 250 commercial spaces, that's why the development agreement was drafted that way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That's why all the documents originally were drafted that way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That's why you were shown 250 commercial spaces below grade for the commercial, for the 60,000 square feet that were going to be producing.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What happened is because of the long period of time it took to get before you, the C-3 parking legislation passed you and then passed the Board of Supervisors so we are now faced with that C-3 parking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Here is what we are doing though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Currently at that site right now there are 450 spaces being used regularly. I mean they are sold out.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We are going to take away those 450 spaces and replace them with 250 spaces, a reduction of 200 while at the same time the Federal Building on the same block is going to be adding 2800 employees with zero parking, we're adding 60,000 sq. ft. - actually a net of 48,000 because we're eliminating that restaurant there - but we're adding 60,000 square feet of commercial space that needs parking and won't have any.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We're under parked in my view.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> If you check the Planning Guidelines on residential, we're producing 1900 units with 1200 spaces.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So, it seems to me to be a fair compromise to allow us to continue to proceed with the 250 spaces that we anticipated until 3 weeks ago.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Similarly, there was an issue about stackers on the 12 spaces.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">All of our parking is below grade.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We don't have the space on the floor to floor to put stackers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We would respectfully request that we not be required to do that.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">12% affordable [in addition to the rent controlled] was the understanding of the parties &ndash; the tenants and Angelo Sangiacomo.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What happened?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Again because of the long period of time a new BMR was passed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is not effective until the Mayor signs it, but at some point he will.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We talked with Chris Daly last week and it was not their intent to capture Trinity.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There was some discussion about changing the definition of the existing tenant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We have agreed to that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We agreed that an existing tenant will be anybody at Trinity Plaza with a lease on the day of the first Certificate of Occupancy or Temporary Certificate of Occupancy.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There was another open issue on the variances that Craig mentioned &ndash; we'll agree.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Give us the parking and the maps.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There is another issue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Somebody is suggesting that the north-south pathway between Mission and Stevenson through the private open space be open to the public.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We can't agree to that and hope you won't make us agree to it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We have a great big public plaza area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's the way it was designed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We expect the building to be mapped with restrictions subject to City Attorney review.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We are going to waive the Ellis Act, waive restrictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There is no way that will be sold as condominiums.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">First of all, we do support the staff recommendation that the short-term parking be eliminated.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There are several hundred parking spaces that are going in next-door that will be short-term and I think you read the article in the Chronicle on Monday.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It mentioned that there are hundreds of potential short-term parking spaces in the C-3 area now.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">They are being leased out in short-term garages but if the demand for short-term parking were to increase, they would go back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The converse is also true.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">If you glut an area with parking spaces, they will go back to leased spaces and that will have an effect on walking and cycling.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We understand some accommodations were made not to shadow 1160 Mission, but we are very concerned about how this project treats the public realm; what it does to Market Street; what it does to Mission Street; and what it does to 8<sup>th</sup> Street.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Market Street in particular is San Francisco's main street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Probably the most important street in terms of urban design in the city.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We feel the additional height, these kind of masses &ndash; slab-like structures pushed up against Mission are going to have bad effects in terms of wind, in terms of urban design, in terms of shadow on a street that has been devastated by a series of bad building on Market.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We would very much like to see a public right of way along that side.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We applaud them for bringing Mission Street all the way through.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But you can see if that public right of way was connected between Stevenson, we would get away from that frequent of a giant wall of building on the south side of Market.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The law was fought by a different organization in San Francisco to ensure affordable housing for the people in greater San Francisco, so why should they be exempted from that?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Also if Trinity isn't planning to sell the buildings then why have a condo mapping?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> What is the purpose of that?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This is the most transit-rich location in the City.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> An additional 400 cars will slow down MUNI that it is facing on Mission Street and Market Street.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's a threat to pedestrians in the neighborhood.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It's incomprehensible that this would be exempt from the inclusionary housing zoning laws.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The rent-controlled units should not be substituted.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Every time the rent controlled units become vacant they will go up to 100% market rate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> So it is really important that they get full inclusionary units, which are deed restricted to particular levels of area median income.</span></li>

The proposed Ordinance would amend Planning Code Article 1.8 in order to allow [1] LCU's (Limited Commercial Uses) and [2] certain NCU's (nonconforming uses) to seek permits which could authorize them to place tables and chairs on public sidewalks. Presently, the Planning Code subjects these uses to restrictions and prohibitions. The proposal would not affect existing Municipal Code provisions relating to the Department of Public Works' (DPW) ability to evaluate and issue annual  CafÃ© Tables and Chairs' permits when certain accessibility criteria are met and when a public notification process has been completed. These provisions allow any such permit to be the subject of a DPW public hearing, the outcome of which may be appealed to the Board of Appeals. The proposed Ordinance was introduced by Supervisor Mirkarimi, as part of Board of Supervisors File Number 061069.</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I have the honor to represent the People's Republic of China.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We are asking an addition to the Consul General's home at 85 St. Elmo Street in order to provide staff bedrooms and staff bathrooms, which are not currently possible.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Because this property is so large, it calls for a PUD approval through the Conditional Use.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At the Commission's request, architect Li Aison can make a detailed presentation about the design.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But since it's been in your packets, this is the fifth time this item has been calendared, we thought we would go to some of the issues that have really been of concern to the neighbors.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As Mr. Badiner says, this is a unique property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is a little under 9/10 of an acre.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Under the code it could be subdivided into individual lots but the People's Republic of China, who really want to meet the Consul General's needs, owns it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It really does not meet China's needs right now.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This enormous property requires 5 full-time staff and right now there is only one bedroom.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">More importantly, security requirements make it necessary for China to host very high-level dignitaries in a quiet and secure setting.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There have been continuous negotiations and discussions with neighbors since this item was first calendared with you in April.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">They covered a range of issues, potentially exploring whether or not it was possible to put these bedrooms inside the house by building on top or excavating the foundation or whether there's potential to put this elsewhere on the property.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> There was a suggestion perhaps cutting down the mature trees to the right of the house and building it up, towards the street; if it is in the rear yard how to make it further away, even from neighbors; smaller tree preservation; landscaping; construction usage; a full range of good neighbor issues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And the agreement I think produces an even better building for neighbors that can meet China's needs.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It basically takes this V-shaped building and rotates it to eliminate that central courtyard and put it away from neighbors.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It involves substantial set backs ranging from 18 feet to 20 feet and a 10-foot set back from the rear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A notch in the southwest corner creates a 29-foot set back from the side yard.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">78 percent of the property will remain as open space.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Every mature tree over 24 inches will be preserved except for one.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There will be a landscape architect will be consulted to do a site-specific site plan and a variety of good neighbor construction measures have been agreed to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Including no construction on Saturday and Sunday and restricted hours of construction.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">With this residential addition, St. Elmo will be able to meet the People's Republic of China's needs for the Consul General.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This is not to be used for commercial purposes like a boarding house or hotel or condos.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although this is an RH-1 (D), a variety of uses are allowed with a conditional use.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The People's Republic of China has voluntarily agreed to a condition that as long as China owns the property, this will only be used for a single family home.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In conclusion, I want to thank those neighbors that have worked so hard for so many months to create a project that would meet China's needs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">They have been honest and honorable and respectful and extremely firm about protecting neighbor's interest.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I want to apologize to neighbors who haven't been able to be part of this and the homeowner's association for fighting to the very last minute to make sure the neighbors' interests was protected.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The People's Republic of China looks forward to being a continuing part of this neighborhood and this City and respectfully requests the Planning Commission approve the revised plans and additions for this residential addition.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The reason I brought this discretionary review up is the neighborhood and various neighbors have been working for three years to try to come up with a compromise for this particular lot.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We feel that this option as well as the previous one that was first submitted in 2003 does not keep in context with the neighborhood.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It is much higher than most of the other buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is much bigger, much bulkier and has a very small yard.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This particular project site, being a corner lot that is about 62 feet wide by 80-some feet long is large enough to accommodate a variety of different options that would not require a variance or any kind of special considerations.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There is plenty of opportunity for designs to have been put forth that would have not required any kind of special considerations.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I feel that if a typical resident of San Francisco were trying to make these types of changes and ask for these variances they probably wouldn't be granted very easily.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This project sponsor has been all along the way getting a lot to support from the Planning Department, even though the neighbors have been against it for the most part.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Although as mentioned there are letters in support, there are also quite a few letters in opposition to this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's been a three-year battle.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I also want to comment on the design and context of this building.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I went through the Residential Design Guidelines and found 10 different issues where this building did not meet them (which I have outlined in my discretionary review).</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A lot of them have to do with the scale, size and context, but also about the design.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I think this neighborhood in San Francisco deserves a building more in context with its neighbors and I hope you agree.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The reason I'm here is because for the last two and a half years I've been trying to figure out exactly what the logic is and justification for allowing that building to have variances.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What's so special about this building that it requires a variance to allow an undersized yard, extensive height and a really bizarre design?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We feel that this corner elevation has a discrepancy of over a foot from the prior design and I'd like to know really where the cornerstone is, because it's relative to the total elevation of this property.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">They appealed this to the Board of Appeals, one of you was on the Board at that time, and the DR request was denied so the soils could be tested.</span></li>
