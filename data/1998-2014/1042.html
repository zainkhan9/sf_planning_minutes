        <p><i>Re:  Information to the Commission</i></p>

        <p>- Informed the public that if they provide documents less than a week before the hearing they cannot expect Commissioners to have reviewed their material or to have a reasonable response to it.</p>

        <p>- She announced that she received items this week on two projects that she has not actually seen.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Work Plan </i></p>

        <p>- This item is scheduled for next week and there is some confusion about what the Commission is looking for.</p>

        <p>- She is asking for something more detailed than just the little pamphlet she received form the Department.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that a discussion can be scheduled that states what the Department is trying to accomplish and what specific actions are being taken in this regard.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Work Plan</i></p>

        <p>- Staff should be able to follow up on this.</p>

        <p>- The budget impacts need to be looked at.  There was a very detailed work plan presented to the Land Use Committee that prioritized projects--but this was before the budget cuts and impacts.</p>

        <p>- Staff is bringing this back in some form that gives detail in terms of priority and a little background as Commissioner Feldstein has just requested.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Acting Zoning Administrator Responded to Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        <p>- The document has been prepared for the review of the Commission next week (9/25/03).</p>

        <p>- If it is not as complete as the Commission wants, staff will be present at the hearing to answer any questions Commissioners might have.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re: Golden Gateway</i></p>

        <p>- He met with people who live in the area and are concerned about a future project that will develop a recreational area as part of the Golden Gateway.</p>

        <p>- He made comments that were his own and not representative of the Commission as a whole.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bill Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Work Plan</i></p>

        <p>- Regarding Commissioner Feldstein's request:  each department is required to submit to the Mayor's Office and the Controller's Office on October 1, performance measures and a customer service plan as required by Charter.  The Charter also requires that a strategic plan be submitted. </p>

        <p>- He assumes that the Commission will receive copies of this information.</p>

        <p>- He also assumes that if the fee increases don't go through (the 1.2 million), staff will break this down and show which plans will not be able to be implemented in this year's work plan.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Acting Zoning Administrator Responded to Commissioner Bill Lee's Comment:</font></p>

        <p>- If we do not receive all of the money, the Commission will receive information on what we can do with the money the department does receive.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

        <p>Amit Ghosh from staff gave a status report on the compilation and distribution schedule of the document for the October 9, 2003 hearing on the Housing Element:</p>

        <p>- The last hearing on the Housing Element was at the end of July where public comment was received.</p>

        <p>- On the 25<sup>th</sup> of August, Commissioners presented their comments to staff.</p>

        <p>- Today, September 18, 2003, there are two documents that will be released.  The first document contains staff's response to Planning Commissioner's comments on the February and July draft of the Housing Element.  This document repeats written comments verbatim, discusses them, and then suggests changes which could be incorporated into the final draft of the Housing Element; The second is the fourth draft of the Housing Element and it incorporates the changes that staff  would recommend to the Commission as a response to their comments and all the public comment which has been received so far.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Marilyn Amini</font></p>

        <p>- She did get a copy of the new release about one hour ago.</p>

        <p>- It is a tremendously large document and there are only three weeks before the hearing of the Housing Element.</p>

        <p>- She urged the Commission to not close public comment.</p>

        <p>- How will the Department notice the hearing on this document?</p>

        <p>- Many commissioners asked that notice go out &quot;piggy backed&quot; in utility bills.</p>

        <p>- She has received three statements (from utility companies) and there is no information about the Housing Element in them.</p>

        <p>- This is a very important proposal going before the Commission and the public needs to know.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Edward Evans</font></p>

        <p>- He requested that the draft materials be made available in alternative format for people with disabilities.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Chris Zelieg</font></p>

        <p>- She requested that public comment be closed on the Housing Element because it needs to move forward and it should be approved by November 6, 2003.</p>

        <ul><ul><ul><ul><p>10. 2002.0277C (A. LIGHT:  (415) 558-6254)</p>

        <p><u>150 GOLDEN GATE AVENUE</u> - north side between Jones and Leavenworth Streets, in Assessor's Block 344, Lot 4.  Request for a Conditional Use authorization to construct a building exceeding 40 feet in height in an R (Residential) District, to determine an appropriate setback at the top portion of the front of the fa&ccedil;ade of the proposed building, and to allow an Institutional Use in an RC (Residential Commercial Combined) District.  The subject property is zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial, Combined, High Density) District, is in the North of Market Special Use District, and is in an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.   The proposal is to demolish an existing four-story, approximately 88-foot high vacant building originally used as a lodge building for the Knights of Columbus, and most recently as office space.  The existing building would be replaced with a new five-story, approximately 78'-0&quot; high building that would house administrative and some on-site service functions of the St. Anthony Foundation which provides a variety of services to homeless and other disadvantaged individuals.  The proposed facility at 150 Golden Gate would function as part of a larger campus of St. Anthony's and would specifically provide space for administrative offices, counseling, health and job training services, and, temporarily, some dining services, until a new dining and residential structure could be constructed across the street.</p>

The project sponsor worked with staff and the neighborhood and developed 19 conditions of approval addressing specific operational impacts from the dining room facility.  At today's hearing, the Planning Commission, at the recommendation of the Acting Director and Zoning Administrator, Jim Nixon, amended several of the conditions to do the following:</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p>1) Extend the hours of operation from 10:00 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. to 10:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>

              <p>2) Simplify language on several of the conditions</p>

              <p>3) Eliminate the portion of Finding No. 21 that referred to a need for City agencies to dedicate more resources to address neighborhood problems and issues in the Tenderloin.</p>
