This special hearing will begin at 1:30 p.m. and the regular Planning Commission hearing will start at 2:30 p.m.<br><br>Commissioner Theoharis: There was a case heard last week regarding 366 Pennsylvania Street.  She has become extremely concerned about units being rented out as a hotel and not being used properly.  She has discovered that not only is there a Pink Pelican but also a Brass Pelican at 26 Teresa Street and that is zoned R-1 and a Green Pelican located at 41 Parsons Street.  These are advertised on the Internet at pelicanrentals.com, which are also advertised in Europe.<br><br>If this information is correct, then there are several units, which have been taken off the market.  These units are violating the unit density and the Planning Code.  She would like to know:  1) if these people are paying hotel tax; 2) do they have a business license; 3) are they subject to the City's payroll tax; 4) is San Francisco entitled to a portion of the sales tax; 5) have they paid sales tax to the Franchise Tax Board; and 6) check with the water department to see if they pay a different rate.<br><br>She would also like to have the audit available on the website since it is such a large document.  <br><br>The Planning Director responded that the audit is available at:  www.sfgov.org/planning.<br>Copies will also be available at the Planning Department.  Hearings on the audit will be scheduled in the future.<br><br>Commissioner Salinas: He would like to know whose jurisdiction is it to follow through on the issue of the pelican rentals.  What laws have been broken?<br><br>Commissioner Baltimore:  Review the codes related to the height of penthouses.  In order for open space to be allowed/legal on the roof or upper levels, it has to be accessible to the disabled. Our codes should be consistent with the building codes in terms of the number of feet necessary.  She would like to have staff outline the necessary changes in order to go through the appropriate Commissions for code change.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>1) The Director announced that today he is also the Acting Zoning Administrator while Mr. Badiner is on vacation.<br><br>2) He responded to the question Commissioner Salinas asked.  <br>The property has to be in compliance with the Planning Code as well as the Municipal Code.  The jurisdiction is of the Planning Department when it has to do with use and how a dwelling unit is being used.  The Planning Department will be looking into this.  If there are issues related to the Building Code, this matter will also be referred to the appropriate departments.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS &ndash; <br>Re:  3224-3252 Pierce Street &ndash; Conditional Use Application for an antenna<br>&ndash; This item was continued without hearing to June 17, 2002.<br><br>Transportation and Commerce Committees<br>Re:  Performance audit of the Planning Department and Planning Commission<br>- This morning he (the Director) attended the hearing regarding the performance audit.<br>- Supervisor McGoldrick is calling for a working group and has acknowledged that this would be the first of many hearings.<br>- Many people who spoke at that hearing showed their support for the Planning Department.<br><br>BOA<br>- Jonas Ionin represented the Zoning Administrator at this hearing.<br><br>Re:  Edgehill Way and 2518 Union Street<br>- Only the final language and findings was before the Board on these cases.<br><br>Re:  51-55 Vicksburg<br>- This was a staff-initiated Discretionary Review for a dwelling unit merger from 3 units to 1.  The Commission approved this merger.  It was appealed and the Board voted +5 -0 to overrule the Commission's action.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informational presentation on building height and the review of code provisions regarding measurements.<br><br>(+) Joe Cassidy<br>- He is in favor of a height increase.<br>(+) Alice Barkley<br>- She is in favor of a height increase.<br>- She would like the Commission to act on this very quickly.<br>- She would like to have legislation written right away.<br>- Many projects are stopped because of this situation.<br>(+) Joe O'Donaghue &ndash; Residential Builders<br>- He is in favor of a height increase.<br>(+) Shawn Gorman<br>- He is in favor of an elevator penthouse and/or access to the roof.<br>- He encourages the Commission to act on this issue as soon as possible.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Informational only.  No Action Required.<br><br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED<br><br>At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.<br><br>Re:  292 Ivy Street<br>(+) Charles Olson &ndash; Sanger and Olson &ndash; Representing Project Sponsor<br>- He submitted additional language for this project.<br>- He requests that the modified approval language allows slightly more time than the staff recommendation to commence construction of the residential units.<br>- Max Limited has every intention of providing the residential units.<br>- He requests consideration of modified language and if the Commission cannot agree on a decision due to absences, that this case be continued to next week's hearing.<br>(+) Peter Hadiaris &ndash; Representing Discretionary Review Requestor<br>- The only new development was that his client was locked out of his premises and they (the sponsors) were ordered by the bankruptcy court to let him back into his premises.<br>(-) Larry Roberts &ndash; Office of Matt Gonzalez<br>- He would like to point out that this district has special zoning.
