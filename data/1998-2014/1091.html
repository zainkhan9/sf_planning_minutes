The site is part of the major city block bounded by Howard Street to the north, Folsom Street to the south, 5th Street to the east, and 6th Street to the west within the South of Market neighborhood. Clementina and Tehama Streets are minor streets bisecting this city block. The proposed project would demolish the existing one-story, 5,000-square-foot warehouse on this 5,625-square-foot site and construct 28 residential condominium units over approximately 1,250 square feet (sq. ft.) of ground-floor commercial space, and eight off-street parking spaces within a new eight-story structure.

The project site is located within the RSD (Residential Service Mixed-Use) zoning district and within the 40-X/85-B height and bulk district. Projects within the RSD zoning district require a conditional use authorization to determine the residential density for buildings over 40 feet in height.

Lee, W. Lee<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>Re:  Continuance<br>Erick Quesada &ndash; Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition<br>- There has been an enormous amount of community planning from both the Planning Department as well as residents of the Mission District.<br>- Any decisions should be waited on in order for the Commission to be briefed.<br>- It is really important to wait to hear cases located in this district and that this case be continued until after the briefing.<br>Cris Sielig &ndash; Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition<br>- She is also in agreement to continue projects which involve residents of the Mission District until the Commission has been briefed on the community planning in this area.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the project sponsor left after the initial action and was not present to hear and respond to comments made by members of the public, the Commission again continued this matter as it was proposed with the understanding that any request for further continuance could be addressed at that time.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bradford Bell, Antonini, Boyd, Feldstein, Hughes, S.

(President Bradford Bell instructed that a roll call voting procedure be used from this point on.) <br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently, department staff went through what they thought was a general public meeting training session.  It turned out that the training session was really designed for Commissioners or Commissions.  The material provided to staff will be copied and forwarded to you.  If anyone is interested, I will arrange this training for you individually or as a body.<br><br>Commissioner Antonini:<br>- He made comments regarding the 4th and Freelon project.<br>- He would like to clarity that the Commission did not at any time discuss this project in regards to height or bulk, nor did they have any input from any of the neighbors.<br>- He understands that this case will be coming before the Commission in the future.<br>- He wanted to mention this to the public so that there are no misunderstandings that there is an approval of the project already.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>- Expressed his hope that Commissioners had a great Thanksgiving.<br><br><br>Re:  Briefing Sessions<br>12/10/02 &ndash; Briefing on the General Plan and the San Francisco Wireless Telecommunications Facilities Siting Guidelines.<br><br>12/12/02 &ndash; Department's Citywide Action Plan which is a way of explaining how all of the long-range planning efforts are related to some common objectives and goals.<br><br>12/17/02  - Better Neighborhood's Programs which involve three areas of the City.<br><br>12/19/02 &ndash; Eastern Neighborhoods like the Industrial Zones, the areas that were subject to the Industrial Protection Zone policies and were under the greatest pressure to change:  Mission District, Showplace Square, SOMA, Visitation Valley and Bay View Hunter's Point.  This order is somewhat important.<br><br>1/9/02 &ndash; There are no briefings scheduled on this date.  This hearing will involve mostly action items.<br><br>1/16/02 &ndash; Presentation on various alternatives that are coming out of the eastern neighborhoods community planning workshops.
