We are trying to determine if I live within 500 feet of the project.  The City Attorney's office will let him know.<br><br>2) Re:  Backlog of Projects<br>He would like to have the department explore various ways to open up more days and/or add more time to each hearing in order to consider Planning Commission cases.  There have been a few cases that had to be continued creating a backlog.  There are some projects that have serious economic consequences if they are delayed.  Perhaps some options would be:  1) making the 5th Thursday of the month a hearing date; 2) starting earlier than 1:30 p.m.; 3) adding an additional evening session in the month.  He would like planning staff to look at these three options to see which would be the most cost <br>effective.<br><br>Commissioner Boyd:<br>Re:  Backlog of Projects<br>He would like to ask staff how extensive the backlog of projects is.  This would make him understand and consider the proposals from Commissioner Antonini.  He would not be in support of having the 5th Thursday of the month as a hearing date.  He would be in support of starting earlier.<br><br>Commissioner Bradford Bell:  <br>She is aware of the concerns from the Commissioners.  She would like the Director, the Commission Secretary and herself  to discuss these concerns and get back to the Commission.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>On February 13, 2003 &ndash; The Department's budget is scheduled for hearing before this Commission.<br><br>On February 20, 2003  &ndash; There will be a presentation on the Telecommunications Guidelines scheduled for hearing before this Commission.<br><br>8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS &ndash; Report by John Paul Samaha<br>Re:  Glen Park Marketplace Project<br>- The Board unanimously voted to uphold the Conditional Use Authorization granted by the Planning Commission at its December 5, 2002 hearing.<br><br>Re:  Fourth and Freelon Special Use District<br>- The Board, acting as a committee as a whole, introduced amendments on this project.  Supervisor Daly, the sponsor of the legislation, introduced an amendment that includes most if not all of the recommendations that were made by the Planning Commission at its January 9, 2003 hearing.  There were a couple of minor amendments made to the amendment of the whole:  1) one was clarifying language about the offsetting of the land acquisition costs to ensure that no less than 56 affordable units were actually build. 2) language added to ensure that the project sponsor has  insurance against construction defects  for the affordable housing units off-site.<br>- The Board of Supervisors could not vote on the amendment of the whole since the City Attorney deemed the amendments substantive.  The matter was continued for one week, when the Committee of the Whole will hold another hearing and vote on the legislation at its February 11, 2003.<br><br>Re:  Land Use Committee<br>- The members of the new Land Use Committee have been established, with the exception of Supervisor Sophie Maxwell.  The Committee Chair will be Supervisor Jake McGoldrick; the Vice Chair will be Supervisor Tony Hall and the other member will be Supervisor Amiano.  This Committee will meet every Monday at 1:00 p.m. beginning February 17, 2003.  This will be a trial period for about 4 to 6 weeks, at which point the Committee might reconsider the need to hold Committee meetings on a weekly basis.<br><br>Re:  New Legislation Introduced<br>1) Supervisor McGoldrick has re-introduced 2 pieces of legislation that had previously been sponsored by former Supervisor Mark Leno:<br>a) Ordinance amending the Planning Code to create and establish controls for Transit-oriented Neighborhood Commercial (NC-T) Districts and Transit-Intensive Special Use Districts.<br>b) Ordinance amending the Planning Code section 253 that currently requires Conditional Use approval for residential construction over 40 feet in residential districts with height limits over 40 fee to add an exception for housing projects that include at least 12 percent affordable units and meet other requirements of the Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program.<br>2) Supervisor Hall introduced the ordinance designating the Laguna Honda Station, also known as the Forest Hill Station, at 390 Laguna Honda Boulevard as a landmark.  The designation had been initiated by the Landmarks Advisory Board and has already been passed by this Planning Commission.

There is a new owner and he has been operating in a different way--he has sought a place of entertainment permit that would allow him to have a DJ (which requires a police permit).  The Police Department referred this permit to the Planning Department.  On September 9, the Planning Department mailed out a Section 312 Notice for a change of Use to add the Place of Entertainment permit.  On September 18, 2002, the Police Department disapproved the Place of Entertainment permit, partially based on a lack of response from the Planning Department--although the 30 days for the 312 Notice had not expired.  We were not notified of this disapproval.  A Discretionary Review was filed within the 30 day period and was scheduled for hearing on December 5, 2002.  In late November, we found out that the Place of Entertainment permit had been denied, thus making the DR moot. The Board of Appeals heard the appeal of the Police Department's disapproval on January 29th and held it to the call of the chair so that the Planning Commission could hear the Discretionary Review.  This all means that there should be more communication between the Police Department and the Planning Department.  This case will come before the Commission on March 6, 2003.<br><br>Re:  2629 24th Street <br>Discretionary Review by a tenant in a building which was being demolished.  This came before the previous Commission.  There were problems with the address because the project sponsor filed it with an address that was different than the one actually on the building.  The previous Commission was concerned about the whole noticing process and denied the building permit, not necessarily because they were opposed to the project, but because they felt that the procedure was not as it should be and that the tenant had not had adequate notice.<br>This was appealed to the BOA.  They granted the permit because the tenant (the DR applicant) had settled with the project sponsor.<br><br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REGULAR CALENDAR<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002.0281EC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.
