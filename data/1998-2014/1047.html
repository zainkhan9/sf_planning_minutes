              <p>ACTION: Following public testimony, the Commission President closed the public hearing.  No action was required of or taken by the Commission.  Acting Director, Larry Badiner, informed the Commission that the Department will modify the Draft Housing Element to include the previous Residence Element language on Secondary Units and commence environmental review and report back to the Commission on what environmental review is appropriate.  The Department ill continue to take written public comment and will hold further public hearings once the environmental document is final.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Bill Lee:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Soundness Report</i></p>

        <p>- What steps or mechanism can the Planning Department take to have some sort of criteria and consistency when planners review soundness reports?</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Feldstein:</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Soundness Report</i></p>

        <p>- The Commission requested that a soundness report be referred back to DBI for some input on the report's accuracy.  She now understands that this report was done by a Commissioner from the Building Inspection Commission.  Is there an issue with the Building Inspection Commissioner making a presentation on something like this?</p>

        <p>Particularly if this project is going to DBI for permitting?</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b><i>City Attorney, Judy Boyajian responded:</i></b></p>

          </ul></ul><p><i>- No, the Building Inspection Commission has designated seats where they represent specific constituencies and they are exempt from the rule against appearing before another board or commission.  They have different conflict of interest rules.  If this project came before the DBI Commission, the particular Commissioner would have to requse himself/herself.</i></p>

              <ul><ul><p><b><i>Acting Director responded:</i></b></p>

          </ul></ul><p><i>- If he recalls correctly, he re-phrased the Commission's request and stated that staff would send the report to another appropriate city agency that has structural engineers.</i></p>

              <ul><ul><p><i>- He did not think that specifically DBI would be the agency.</i></p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Bill Lee:</b></p>

        <p><b>- </b>He recommends that we send this document to either the Department of Public Works or Public Utilities Commission.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p>Re:  Housing Element</p>

        <p>- He was encouraged to see a few articles in the Chronicle regarding the Housing Element.</p>

        <p>- He feels that it is their duty to actively solicit the engagement of the public on something as important as this.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>6. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Commissioner's Questions</i></p>

        <p>- He has received a number of concerns from staff about Commissioner's problems with case reports or case material.  To the extent possible, staff would like commissioners to call them in advance of the hearing with any questions or concerns they may have so staff can adequately respond.  Because this is addressing commissioner's concerns on items scheduled for hearing, it is not viewed as assignments to staff from commissioners.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  commissioner Lee's Request:</i></p>

        <p>- Mr. Nikitas has been working diligently to provide a standard for demolition reports.</p>

        <p>- Staff is trying to set up a training session on these reports.</p>

        <p>- DBI has volunteered to work with planners.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Articles that were in the Chronicle</i></p>

        <p>- It is good when the department gets public exposure on an item that is so critical and that many people feel is very important.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>7. Review of past week's events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>BOS - None</b></p>

        <p><b>BOA</b></p>

        <p><i>Re:  701 Lombard Street</i></p>

        <p>- The Commission heard this case and approved it with modifications.  The Board of Appeals upheld the case.  The Board of Supervisors had an appeal of the Environmental determination that the acquisition of that property for Park and Rec would have a categorical exemption.  That challenge was withdrawn.  The environmental review at the BOS was over in a matter of 15 minutes.  Then the BOS had a six hour hearing on weather to acquire the property or not.  This was then continued to a later date.</p>

        <p><b>(+/-) Jeffrey Heller</b></p>

        <p>- In his view Proposition K is a good thing.</p>

        <p>- The main issue here is to ask what is substantial and what is not?</p>

        <p>- On any certain part of the day, shadows can be significant.</p>

        <p>- The shadow formula does not take into account trees, etc.</p>

        <p>- There should be a proper threshold of analysis so that the evaluation is meaningful.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Adina Rosemarin</b></p>

        <p>- She is director of a small park near Stonestown.</p>

        <p>- She has factual experience of the operation of this criteria.</p>

        <p>- She has been working on the Stonestown project and under these criteria the shadow would be insignificant. Unfortunately, these criteria are entirely done by arithmetic, not actual.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Monica Garcia - Mission Housing</b></p>

        <p>- There are petitions from 50 of the 63 units that are in support of this community room.</p>

        <p>- All the tenants are in support of turning the garage into the community room.</p>

        <p>- The garage for the tenants is free.  There are more than enough spaces for tenants to part their cars if they have one.  The loss of these spaces would not have negative impacts.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Lilian Backtor - Mission Housing</b></p>

        <p>- She was a tenant coordinator for the Mariposa Gardens.</p>

        <p>- There are a lot of activities that are done without adequate space or community rooms.</p>

        <p>- The resident meetings are done outside in a courtyard where people have to wear their jackets when there is cold weather.</p>

        <p>- Mariposa Gardens does not benefit from any funds.</p>

        <p>- A community room is very much needed.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+/-) Fred Snyder</b></p>

        <p>- He owns property across the street from Mariposa Gardens.</p>

        <p>- He has not had any problems with any of the tenants there.</p>

        <p>- There are a few tenants that park outside on the street.</p>

        <p>- It would be a good idea to wait until the policies are established for the Eastern Neighborhood rezoning.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Department, MAC etc. will be working together to have some policies established.</p>

        <p>- If this project is granted he would like to see a requirement that when meetings are held there the community should be invited also. </p>

        <p><b>(-) Gregory Twiss</b></p>

        <p>- He works across the street from the proposed project.</p>

        <p>- The parking in the neighborhood is very difficult.</p>

        <p>- He observes that the business community in the area does have a need to park on the street as well.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Bernard Glaser</b></p>

        <p>- He is president of a club in the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- Parking in the area is not very good.</p>

        <p>- Many people end up parking in the Safeway parking lot, which is about three blocks away.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Dave Snyder</b></p>

        <p>- He is in favor of this project.</p>

        <p>- He is surprised that there are people here opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- The tenants at the development should be allowed to have a community room.</p>

        <p>- The excess parking should not have even been built.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Gary Right</b></p>

        <p>- He is a resident of Mariposa Gardens.</p>

        <p>- They will just reassign tenants to parking spaces so they will not use any parking spaces in nearby lots or on the street.</p>

        <p>- Tenants will be able to have space for their cars.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Melania Miller</b></p>

        <p>- She has been a resident of Mariposa Gardens for 20 years.</p>

        <p>- This space will be a place for 63 tenants to meet, study, train, converse, etc.  She cannot believe that there are people who are opposed to this.</p>

        <p>- When there are tenant meetings they have to meet outside in the cold, covered with scarves, gloves, etc.</p>

        <p>- She remembers that she used to have to travel long distances to take her children to community areas.  This will benefit the families that still have little children.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p>- This would be the best gift the Commission could give to her today because it is her birthday.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Carlos Romero - Executive Director for Mission Housing</b></p>

        <p>- There has been 20 years of operation.</p>

        <p>- He takes public transportation.  When he passes by the complex he sees various parking spaces nearby.  There is no evidence that there is a need for additional parking.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will consider approval of this project.</p>

        <p>- There is a low-income grant they received that would help fund the project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Maria Lila Sanchez</b></p>

        <p>- She has been living in Mariposa Gardens for 15 years.</p>

        <p>- She agrees with building this community room.  This would provide an opportunity for tenants to have parties and other activities.  The youth need a place to meet and not have to be on the streets.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Eric Quezada - Mission Housing</b></p>

        <p>- The real impacts on parking and development took place during the dotcom boom because of the lofts, etc.</p>

        <p>- Today, this project will be a benefit to many people for many years.</p>

        <p>- This is the best for community safety because it will be a place for tenants to meet.</p>

        <p>- Bryant Square will actually add parking spaces in the area.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Mario Zuniga - Manager of Mariposa Gardens</b></p>

        <p>- There is a real need to build this community room especially for the children.  It will give them a place to go and opportunities for activities that will help keep them busy.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Deby Gonzales - Tenant Coordinator for Mariposa Gardens</b></p>

        <p>- She is looking forward to having this community room.</p>

        <p>- She owns a car and has always been able to find parking on the street.</p>

        <p>- It would be nice to have a place where there will be coffee, books, etc.</p>

        <p>- It is difficult to plan events outside.</p>

Rather than leave a 22' wide gap in the North Point Street frontage, the proposal is to construct an approximately 40' X 22' portion of the project fully into the rear yard along North Point Street, leaving a comparable rear yard to the interior of the lot of approximately 1,480 square feet.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES</u> - Presentation on the updated and expanded Residential Design Guidelines (Guidelines) for all residential projects in RH (Residential House) and RM (Residential Mixed-Density) zoning districts.  This is a second hearing on the proposed Guidelines after receiving comments and recommendations from the public at the May 22, 2003 hearing, and at follow up meetings held by Department staff with interested individuals, neighborhood groups and other organizations. This hearing is to provide another opportunity for the public to comment on the draft Guidelines. No action is required by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may adopt the Guidelines at a future public hearing.</p>

        <p>(Continued from Regular meeting of August 21, 2003)</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><b>Katherine Howard - Chair SPUR Sustainable Development Committee</b></p>

        <p>- The committee has reviewed the May 2003 Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

        <p>- She submitted a document with suggestions for amendments to the guidelines.  The suggestions are geared to the following sections of the guidelines:  Urban Design Principals, Neighborhood Character, Site Design, Building Scale and Form, Architectural Features and Building Details.</p>

        <p><b>Alan Martinez - San Francisco Board of the Institute of Architects</b></p>

        <p>- The Institute has not had a chance to completely review the guidelines but they are happy that their suggestions were included in this draft.</p>

        <p>- There should be language related to unusual designed buildings.</p>

        <p>- From time to time there will be buildings that they will want to allow exceptions for.</p>

        <p>- PG&amp;E has their own standards of where utility lines will go.  So some issues will have to be coordinated in a specific way.</p>

        <p><b>Bruce Bonacker - National Association of the Remodeling Industry/AIA</b></p>

        <p>- They were very happy with these guidelines.  He would expect that with some minor modifications they should be passed.</p>

        <p>- One of the problems that their members have are the delays because of misunderstandings or the lack of clarity at the beginning of a project.  A goal should be to develop on clarity, to the extent that it is possible.</p>

        <p>- He asked the Commission to turn to staff and schedule in an 18<sup>th</sup> month period to do a re-review to see how well this is going to see if there are some tweaking to make things work better.</p>

        <p>- He is very pleased that the Secretary of Interior Standards for Historic Preservations are used in these guidelines.  He is just concerned that there are buildings with various levels of merit of a historical importance.  It is important to be careful on how these standards are applied.</p>

        <p><b>John Schlesinger</b></p>

        <p>- He echoes his colleague's remarks in regards to being happy with the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- There is one item in the guidelines that discusses the prevailing character with roofs.  Sloped roofs can minimize the aspect of larger buildings.  This item should not be overlooked.</p>

        <p>- This is the time to direct staff to set a precedent on setting projects.</p>

        <p><b>Terry Milne</b></p>

        <p>- He too would like to commend staff on the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- He appreciates the fact that the Planning Department has done a lot of detail on various aspects of design.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Informational only.  Staff will look into scheduling this for adoption on December 4, 2003.</p>
