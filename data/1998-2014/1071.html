COOPER: (415) 558-5974)<br>SAN FRANCISCO CRUISE TERMINAL MIXED-USE PROJECT AND BRANNAN STREET WHARF PROJECT - CERTIFICATION OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT (SEIR). The proposed project would involve two components: 1) the construction of two berths (including necessary dredging) and a new terminal for cruise ships that call at the Port of San Francisco, as well as ancillary commercial development, all on Pier 30-32 (Block 9900, Lots 30 and 32); and 2) the construction of a residential project on Seawall Lot 330 (Block 3770, Lots 1 and 2, Block 3771, Lot 1), across the Embarcadero from Pier 30-32. The cruise terminal would contain about 100,000 gross square feet (gsf) of floor area, while the commercial element would include about 370,000 gsf of office space and about 220,000 gsf of retail/entertainment space. About 450 parking spaces would be provided on the pier. The residential component, on the block bounded by the Embarcadero and Beale and Bryant Streets, would include about 350 dwelling units and 350 parking spaces. The SEIR also analyzes a separate but related project involving the design and construction of the Brannan Street Wharf (Block 9900), Lots 34 and 36), a new, approximately 57,000-square-foot waterfront park along the Embarcadero just south of Pier 30-32..
