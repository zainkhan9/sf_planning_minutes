      <p>7. Commission Comments/Questions</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner S. Lee:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: Position of Planning Director</i></p>
      <p>- She would like to have this item heard at a time specific on August 
        5, 2004.</p>
      <p>- She would also like to have this calendar mailed to the neighborhood 
        list.</p>
      <p>- She requested the current job description of the current planning director 
        position and job announcements when Director Green was hired.</p>
      <p>- She is under the understanding that the Mayor's Office issued a job 
        announcement in a Planning publication. She would like a copy of this.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: Position of Planning Director</i></p>
      <p>- He feels that the qualifications for Director of Planning should be 
        revised as well as look at the pay scale of that position.</p>
      <p>- It is also important to know what the position is responsible for and 
        what it is not responsible for.</p>
      <p>- Would like to ask Mr. Kawasaki, the Acting Director of DHR, what the 
        Commission can do and cannot do. Maybe he can attend the hearing.</p>
      <p>- Other issues to look at are: Should the City pay for expenses of candidates 
        who come to an interview in the City? Should the City pay for moving costs 
        of a candidate if chosen and he/she lives out of town?</p>
      <p>- What is required to put in writing?</p>
      <p>- There is no requirement for what the director is required to have under 
        the Charter and the Administrative Code. It would be helpful if staff 
        went over the Charter and Administrative Code regarding this.</p>
      <p><i>Re: 80 Natoma</i></p>
      <p>- There is a letter from Alice Barkley. Does the Commission have to respond?</p>
      <ul>
        <p><font class="heading2">Director Green Responded:</font></p>
        <p>- He realizes that Ms. Barkley spoke to the Commission related to 80 
          Natoma.</p>
        <p>- There is a letter from the Building Department that came to the Acting 
          Director.</p>
        <p>- He has replied to the letter and has done what is requested of them.</p>
        <p>- Apparently the issue is of compliance with a previous Commission's 
          authorization. This responsibility rests on the Department and not on 
          the Commission. If it were a Commission issue, the item would have to 
          be placed on the calendar.</p>
        <p><font class="heading2">City Attorney Cleveland-Knowles responded:</font></p>
        <p>- She has not seen the letter. She understands that Deputy City Attorney 
          Boyajian is aware of this letter.</p>
        <p><font class="heading2">Director Green Responded:</font></p>
        <p>- He has consulted with the City Attorney.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><i>Re: City Stat</i></p>
      <p>- It is important that the Commission receives this information.</p>
      <ul>
        <p><font class="heading2">Director Green Responded</font></p>
        <p>- He will appear before City Stat tomorrow morning. They provided a 
          chart of information that they requested. Staff has not received that 
          chart back. There is no pre-presentation.</p>
        <p>- At the August hearing, staff will provide the Commission with the 
          information that they will present to the committee.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>
      <p>Re: Public Comment</p>
      <p>- A few members of the public have requested that this item be moved 
        towards the beginning of the calendar.</p>
      <ul>
        <p><font class="heading2">Commission Secretary responded:</font></p>
        <p>- This is a highly contested item and it involves amending the Commission's 
          official Rules and Regulations. It is up to the Commission [or the President] 
          to instruct me to scheduled this for a future hearing.</p>
      </ul>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: Code of Order for Choosing a Planning Director</i></p>
      <p>- He would like to know what order this process should follow.</p>
      <p>- He would like to receive this information in writing.</p>

      <p>8. Director's Announcements</p>
      <p><i>Re Newspaper Article</i></p>
      <p>- There was an article in the newspaper stating that he had submitted 
        his resignation. This information is not true.</p>
      <p>9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board 
        of Appeals</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">BOS:</font></p>
      <p><i>Re: Ordinance related to Amending the CM Zoning District</i></p>
      <p>- This legislation was amended and acted on at the Board by a vote of 
        +7 -4.</p>
      <p><i>Re: 55 Ninth Street</i></p>
      <p>- This was approved at the Board.</p>
      <p><i>Re: Budget</i></p>
      <p>- The Board, on first read, did consider the City's Budget.</p>
      <p>- The second reading and final decision still needs to be acted upon.</p>
      <p>- The Department's approved budget for fiscal year 2003-2004 and the 
        actuals at the end of the that year totaled $13.2 million. The proposed 
        budget the Department brought before the Commission and then presented 
        to the Mayor's office totaled $14.1 million. The Mayor presented the Department's 
        budget to the BOS's budget committee for a total amount of $16 million. 
        This looks like a substantial increase over the Department's proposed 
        budget. However, there are some significant differences. In the Department's 
        budget there was an amount of $3.8 million that we were hoping would come 
        from the General Fund. The budget that was presented to the Board by the 
        Mayor's office did not include an allocation from the General Fund. The 
        budget did include a greater reliance on fees and an expectation of a 
        fee increase. There has been a fee proposal that is being considered by 
        the BOS. The budget also included a fund transfer from DBI. The budget 
        that was adopted by the BOS called for funding for the Department at $16.5 
        million. This was different from the budget that was presented by the 
        Mayor. The department received a small amount of General Fund support 
        which totaled $447 thousand. This amount was to cover work responding 
        to the Board's requests. There was also a restoration of the amount of 
        funds that were devoted to interdepartmental recovery. There was also 
        a slight difference in the amount of revenue that was to be generated 
        from fees. It still relied on a fee increase proposal. </p>
      <p>- This budget is still going to have a final reading and it is still 
        a bit confusing. [He will still have to come back to the Commission to 
        try to explain a few things.] </p>
      <p>- In this budget the department lost 11 positions, three of which were 
        vacant. Those positions were replaced with 12 positions. There is a net 
        increase of 1 position. The vacancies have been lost. There is a greater 
        reliance on front line staff. The primary changes have been in administration 
        and upper management. He sees this as a challenge on how people will be 
        managed.</p>
      <p>- This budget does allow the department to have work items that did not 
        exist before. The new budget that the Mayor's office contributed to allows 
        for funds which the department would have had to obtain from it's own 
        budget. As an example, the City Attorney's office is an expense that all 
        departments have to incur. The department has been provide with fund to 
        take care of this expense. There are funds for consultants to be able 
        to do environmental work, bring on urban design, and do transit work.</p>
      <p>- When there is a full Commission (all seven members), the issue of the 
        budget should be on the calendar to talk about various details. </p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Lee:</font></p>
      <p>- She requested that a copy of the budget be given to the Commission 
        in preparation of the briefing the Director will have when there is a 
        full Commission.</p>
      <p>- This information should include what changes in the organizational 
        structure the budget calls for.</p>
      <ul>
        <p><font class="heading2">Director Green Responded:</font></p>
        <p>- The department has not received a copy of the budget but the Commission 
          will receive it when we do. This item will be placed on the calendar.</p>

      <p>- He was raised in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>- He has been involved with real estate and music all of his life.</p>
      <p>- This would be a haven for aspiring musicians and recording artists.</p>
      <p>- This would be the first time a school, rehearsal facility, hotel, and 
        a music venue have ever been looped together.</p>
      <p>- Musicians can come from all over the city, the country and the world 
        and have a place where they can flourish and pollinate each other.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Brown</font></p>
      <p>- He is opposed to this idea.</p>
      <p>- He has lived in the area for 30 years.</p>
      <p>- The area is also a residential district with a senior home nearby. 
        This is going to lead to more problems because of the early morning hours 
        of operation.</p>
      <p>- He does not want the Commission to pass this because of the violence 
        and prostitution in the area.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jack Rummel</font></p>
      <p>- There are a lot of problems with prostitution and drug dealing in the 
        area.</p>
      <p>- His concern is related to the residential hotel aspect of the project.</p>
      <p>- He does not agree with the late night hours.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Doug Backsberg</font></p>
      <p>- He lives on Sutter Street.</p>
      <p>- He opposes allowing any conditional use.</p>
      <p>- He is appalled that he has to be here since the area is filled with 
        bars, homeless shelters, needle exchange, etc.</p>
      <p>- Fern Alley is only one way, this would cause a problem with the bar 
        since there would be a need for a two way street.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Robert Pangburn</font></p>
      <p>- He owns property in the neighborhood.</p>
      <p>- He has been working against the crime and prostitution in the area. 
        A lot of groups have been formed in order to control these problems.</p>
      <p>- There are crime maps put out by the police that state what kind of 
        crimes are conducted in San Francisco neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>- There are 237 prostitution incidences, 109 larceny and theft incidences, 
        etc.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gus Holinsgworth</font></p>
      <p>- He has lived on Sutter Street for about 20 years.</p>
      <p>- He is opposed to this business because of the stated crime problems.</p>
      <p>- Even though the resources are there to fight the crimes, adding businesses 
        that will help increase the crime is bad for the neighborhood.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Overdurf</font></p>
      <p>- He would like to have a continuance of this project because there should 
        be more public outreach.</p>
      <p>- The project sponsor should have more time to meet with the neighbors.</p>
      <p>- The bottom line is &quot;what is important to the community&quot;</p>
      <p>- If the Commission approves the project, there will be a lot of unhappy 
        people.</p>
      <p>- If the Commission does not approve this, it might not be fair to the 
        project sponsor.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Suzie Shimizu</font></p>
      <p>- She is an administrator at Redding School. Every day the children see

      <p>- He has lived for 43 years on Sutter Street.</p>
      <p>- He would like to have this project denied because there are too many 
        bars in the area.</p>
      <p>- This neighborhood has grammar schools and two old folks homes . </p>
      <p>- The area should be rezoned since the community does not want any more 
        bars.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jenny Hansen</font></p>
      <p>- She is the executive director of a senior center.</p>
      <p>- She is opposed to the project.</p>
      <p>- There are already a lot of crimes going on in the area.</p>
      <p>- Many of her staff have been mugged.</p>
      <p>- A minimum should be to just continue the project if not deny the project 
        all together.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Karla Rossi - Sutter House Apartments</font></p>
      <p>- She is a property manager.</p>
      <p>- There is a music studio on Fern Alley and there are already negative 
        impacts going on now.</p>
      <p>- She is opposed to live entertainment.</p>
      <p>- More information should be sent to the residents of the neighborhood.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Robert Garcia - Save Our Streets</font></p>
      <p>- This is a bad idea. He is not against the school/training facility.</p>
      <p>- The bar aspects of the project will cause more problems.</p>
      <p>- Parking in the area is scarce.</p>
      <p>- On the same block can be found a senior center, a school, etc. This 
        should be cause for denying this type of use.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-/+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable 
        City</font></p>
      <p>- They support the parking variance. He is isolating his comments to 
        the variance only.</p>
      <p>- The project is located in an area where there is excellent transportation.</p>
      <p>- He is sympathetic to the issues of noise, problems with neighbors, 
        etc.</p>
      <p>- He recommends to have strict good neighbor gesture conditions applied 
        to the project so that within a period of time there could be an evaluation 
        of these conditions to make sure they are being followed.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Riddick</font></p>
      <p>- He lives on Fern Alley.</p>
      <p>- He understands the people that have lived in the neighborhood for a 
        long time and their concerns with crime.</p>
      <p>- The live music will be on the Bush Street side.</p>
      <p>- A continuance would be acceptable so that they can give more information 
        to their neighbors.</p>
      <p>- It is not all about the bar, it is more about the community of musicians 
        coming together.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bob Frane</font></p>
      <p>- He is opposed to the proposal even though what the project sponsor 
        is doing is something good.</p>
      <p>- Parking is very bad in the area. Late at night is even worse.</p>
      <p>- He has not heard anyone address the square footage usage of the building.</p>
      <p>- If this is allowed as it stands, later down the line, the conditions 
        should be revisited again.</p>
      <p>- There is a lot of noise on Bush Street.</p>
      <p>- The neighbors are trying to make the area better. He would agree to 
        a continuance so that everyone can get to know the project sponsor more.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mr. Leonard - Noise Control</font></p>
      <p>- He has come up with a plan so that the project sponsor can have this 
        project and have little impact on the neighbors.</p>
      <p>- He agrees that young musicians need a place to rehearse and that this 
        place should be sound controlled so as not to disrupt neighbors.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Christopher Moscone - Representing Project Sponsor</font></p>
      <p>- He requested a continuance because there are only four members of the 
        Planning Commission.</p>
      <p>- If there were a continuance it would allow the [staff] recommendation 
        and analysis to be looked at and corrected--there is a lot of information 
        that is not correct.</p>
      <p>- A continuance would be in the best interest of both parties because 
        it would allow them to meet and come to a decision.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>
      <p>- He agrees to a continuance only if the project could be scheduled on 
        August 5.</p>
      <p>- His clients had to come from Italy for this hearing. </p>
      <p><font class="heading2">Name unclear</font></p>
      <p>- He agrees to a continuance.</p>
      <p>- He just recently hired an attorney. This would allow the attorney to

        of what the project proposes as well as the description of the project.</p>
      <p>- This is an awful project.</p>
      <p>- The issue here is not what could be built under the code but what should 
        be built.</p>
      <p>- The project sponsor should be allowed to build but within the envelope 
        of the structure.</p>
      <p>- There have not been any plans since May 21.</p>

      <p>- He is not too concerned with the fa&ccedil;ade.</p>
      <p>- He made conditional changes to the plans of the houses he has under

      <p>- She is concerned with traffic problems.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bruce Bonacker - Representing the Discretionary

      <p>- The concerns that remain on this project are the scale, precedent, 
        and presence of light and air.</p>
      <p>- The addition is more than 70 percent of the size of the house even 
        though there has been reference to this being a modest addition.</p>
      <p>- He presented a few alternatives, which would be a one-bedroom addition.</p>
      <p>- The other alternative would change the size of the deck. This alternate 
        responds to the needs of his clients.</p>
      <p>- These revisions were not acceptable to the project sponsor.</p>
      <p>- Everyone is concerned about the precedent this will have on the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned with the privacy he will be loosing.</p>
      <p>- He will also be loosing morning light.</p>
      <p>- He is asking for an additional offset.</p>

        and neighborhood character.</p>
      <p>- She and her husband constructed an addition with the required permits.</p>
      <p>- All they are asking for is a skylight.</p>
      <p>- She hopes that the Commission will allow Discretionary Review.</p>
      <p>- The project sponsor promised a few things but then he retreated and 
        mentioned that he over spoke.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Thomas Chan</font></p>
      <p>- They have been thrust into turmoil trying to reach a compromise.</p>
      <p>- The project will impact their privacy and they will lose a lot of light.</p>

        deck removed.</p>

      <p>- Their children's well being is being compromised with this new construction.</p>
      <p>- An important factor when they purchased their home was light and that 
        is going to be minimized with the construction.</p>
      <p>- She requested that the project sponsor set back the addition and remove

        alternatives.</p>

      <p>- He displayed a diagram of the project explaining the relation of the 
        light well to the property.</p>

        children and his wife's mother. Now his children are pre-teens and should 
        be allowed their separate rooms.</p>
      <p>- He requested that the Commission deny Discretionary Review.</p>

      <p>- They have tried to do their best to talk to their neighbors and reach 
        a compromise.</p>

        suggested.</p>
      <p>- She believes it is very critical for the Planning Commission to support 
        growing families.</p>
      <p>- They have tried to do their best to be good neighbors.</p>

        and his brother.</p>

      <p>- This project would not adversely change the character of the neighborhood.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Myriam Chan</font></p>
      <p>- She supports this project since the project sponsor's family is growing. 
        It is time for the children to have their own space as well as their grandmother.</p>
      <p>- The addition would be invisible from a pedestrian point of view.</p>
      <p>- The Planning Commission should support growing families.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Vickie Fan</font></p>
      <p>- She lives down the street from the Swingles.</p>
      <p>- Expansion of existing space seems to be the only way for families to 
        stay in San Francisco.</p>
      <p>- After the project sponsor expands, they will still not have a very 
        large house.</p>
      <p>- It is important to find a way for families to stay together.</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Darvin Huang</font></p>

        when designing this addition.</p>
      <p>- They have been working continuously with the Planning Department.</p>
      <p>- He met with the Golden Gate Heights Association and they gave their 
        consent for the project.</p>
      <p>- He has maintained the setbacks.</p>

        concerns of the neighbors.</p>
      <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review with the following modifications: 1) 
        set the entire front wall of the proposed vertical addition back by 15' 
        from the existing front structural/building wall that meets grade; 2) 
        Match the length of the lightwell on the proposed addition, from front 
        to rear, with the neighbor's lightwell at 2007 9<sup>th</sup> Avenue; 
        3) the plans should indicate a 1-hour fire-rated roof, and that the parapet 
        be no higher than required under the Building Code for such a roof.</p>

          <p><u>2654-58 WEBSTER STREET</u> - east side between Green and Vallejo 
            Streets; Lot 017 in Assessor's Block 0565 - <font class="heading2">Mandatory 
            Discretionary Review</font>, under the Planning Commission's Policy 
            on Dwelling Unit Mergers, of Building Permit Application No. 2003.12.18.2640, 
            proposing to convert a three-family dwelling to a two-family dwelling 
            in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) District and a 40-X Height 
            and Bulk District. The work will not result in any dimensional change 
            to the exterior of the building.</p>
          <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and 
            approve the project as submitted.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>
      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Brett Gladstone - Representing Project Sponsor</font></p>
      <p>- This project will not be detrimental to the supply of housing.</p>
      <p>- The downstairs unit is not rented out and it was vacated voluntarily.</p>
      <p>- The second main floor characteristics make it clear that it used to 
        be used as a dining room.</p>
      <p>- The fa&ccedil;ade is in very poor condition. The Project Sponsor will 
        get a construction loan to upgrade the interior and exterior.</p>
      <p>- The other units have two tiny kitchens.</p>
      <p>- The building started its life from two units and now it is three.</p>
      <p>ACTION: Approved</p>

  <p><font class="heading2">G. PUBLIC COMMENT</font></p>
  
<ul>
  <p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of 
    interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of 
    the Commission except agenda items. With respect to agenda items, your opportunity 
    to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the 
    meeting with one exception. When the agenda item has already been reviewed 
    in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify 
    and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address 
    the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the 
    Calendar. Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three 
    minutes. </p>
  <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item 
    not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public 
    comment. In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>
  <p>(1) responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; 
    or</p>
  <p>(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; 
    or </p>
  <p>(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda. (Government Code 
    Section 54954.2(a))</p>

  <p><i>Re: Discretionary Review Process</i></p>
  <p>- He lives on 9<sup>th</sup> Avenue.</p>
  <p>- He would encourage the Commissioners to revise the DR process.</p>
  <p>- For $140 anyone can DR a project.</p>
  <p>- There are so many opinions because there is such a diversity of people 
    in San Francisco.</p>
  <p>- There should be a more efficient DR process--perhaps put more of a financial 
    burden on requestors.</p>
</ul>
<p>Adjournment: 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>THESE MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING 
  COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 2, 2004.</p>
<p>SPEAKERS: None</p>
<p>ACTION: Approved</p>
<p>AYES: Antonini, S. Lee, W. Lee, Olague</p>
