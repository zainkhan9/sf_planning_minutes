    <p>4.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Commissioner Bill Lee:</b></p>

        <p>He requested that staff work with the Department of Public Works regarding the placement of PG&amp;E Capacitors on City Streets and set up some guidelines.  Some of these capacitors should be grounded and not on posts.  As part of the priorities for the Planning Department for next year, staff should figure out if there is a way to regulate a placement for these capacitors.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

        <p>- Wished a happy birthday to Jim Nixon.</p>

        <p>- Wished a happy anniversary (2 year with the department) to Jean Paul Samaha.</p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

        <p>- In case the public was not able to see last week's hearing, he had asked for the amendment process to possibly begin on the Housing Element before such time as the environmental review was complete and basically the feeling from the Commission was that that was not what they wanted to do.  </p>

        <p><b>Commissioner Sue Lee:</b></p>

        <p>- Regarding the Board of Supervisors not having a process in place to deal with appeals.  She asked if staff had communicated this question to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Acting Director Badiner responded:</b></p>

          </ul></ul><p>- He feels that staff has communicated this in an informal way to the Board of Supervisors.  The first of these appeals is coming up next week for 701 Lombard Street.  He was going to make a somewhat impassioned plea at that time.</p>

              <ul><ul><p>- Everybody deserves a clear process.</p>

        </ul></ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Sue Lee:</b></p>

        <p>- She requested that staff submit a letter regarding this issue to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p><b>Jean Paul Samaha:</b></p>

          </ul></ul><p>- Supervisor Peskin has introduced legislation about the CEQA appeals to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        </ul><p><b>Commissioner Bradford Bell:</b></p>

        <p>- She also wished a happy birthday to Linda Avery.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><b>C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</b></p>

    <ul><ul><p>5. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Changes in Last Year's Budget</i></p>

        <p>- In September, staff reported on the changes in last year's budget.  A few weeks ago staff reported on the audit.  It is now time to start working on next year's budget.  </p>

        <p>- Staff has begun discussions on the budget although we have not received formal instructions from the Mayor's Office.</p>

        <p>- He wants to start this so that Commissioners can begin to make comments on various issues like the work program, what the priorities are, etc.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>BOS - November 25, 2003 Hearing: </b></p>

        <p><i>Land Use Committee Meeting</i></p>

        <p>888 Howard Street</p>

        <p>- This was a hotel that was approved by the previous Commission.  It is a 34 story hotel that required rezoning for a height reclassification and some changes in terms of transfer development rights because there were not enough in the District to building this project.  The Staff and the Commission had concerns about open space.  The open space did not meet the solar access guidelines.  The determination was that about 4,000 square feet more of open space should be developed.</p>

        <p>- The Board recommended approval of the reclassifications that allowed the project to go ahead.  Without comment, the Board approved it.  He apologized, but does not remember the vote.</p>

        <p><b>BOA:</b></p>

        <p><i>3632 Sacramento Street</i></p>

        <p>In 1992, the Commission allowed the conversion of a dwelling unit to office on the second floor.  There was a window of opportunity when this could be done legally.  The owner of the building died and the new owner tried to get the permit later but the Planning Department would not allowed it.  This was appealed to the Board.  The City Attorney advised the Board that they could not hear the case but they heard it anyway.  The Board overturned the Commission's decision and allowed the conversion of the dwelling unit.</p>

    <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><b>(+) Eric Tao - AGI Capital</b></p>

    <p>- The project is scaled appropriately for future growth and development of the area.</p>

    <p>- The project is consistent with the San Francisco General Plan.</p>

    <p>- The project is also designed by an award winning architectural firm.</p>

    <p>- The project has also met requirements by various neighborhood groups.</p>

    <p>- The EIR has demonstrated that there will be a demand in parking.</p>

    <p><b>(+) John Sheeky - Architects International</b></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- The architect gave a PowerPoint presentation on the architectural aspects of the project.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><b>(+) Jim Haas - Civic Pride</b></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- This project is a residential project and will help the area become a residential neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The mid-Market PAC EIR states that there will be a parking deficit in the next few years.</p>

        <p>- Civic Center is a very unique place.</p>

        <p>- All the surface parking is disappearing.</p>

        <p>- The parking garage will fill a great need to keep the area vibrant and flourishing.</p>

        <p><b>(-/+) Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City</b></p>

        <p>- He opposes this project on behalf of TLC.  If one looks at the residential and the commercial, it would be a good project.</p>

        <p>- The parking garage is a dead streetscape.</p>

        <p>- This City deserves world-class development.</p>

        <p>- He recommends that the Commission direct the developer to construct more housing and less parking and to make the 5 stories along Stevenson Street a little bit more active.</p>

        <p>- The developer can make a good project even better.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Jim Salinas - Carpenter's Union Local 22</b></p>

        <p>- The members that he represents support this project because the project sponsor has taken his responsibilities very seriously.</p>

        <p>- This is a better use for that piece of property.  There is a demand for parking in the area.</p>

        <p>- The affordable housing component can only help the City of San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- He hopes to see young brothers and sisters start new careers because of this project.</p>

        <p>- He asked the Commission to support this project.</p>

        <p><b>(+) Vicky Velarde </b></p>

        <p>- She lives in Santa Rosa, but comes to enjoy the theatre in the Civic Center area.</p>

        <p>- Transportation into and out of San Francisco is very difficult.</p>

        <p>- At night parking is difficult and sometimes impossible.</p>

        <p>- It would be nice to have a parking garage that would be safe and well lit adding to her ability to enjoy the wonderful City of San Francisco.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Norman Rolfe - San Francisco Tomorrow</b></p>

        <p>- San Francisco already has traffic congestion problems.  It is important to put more people on public transportation.</p>

        <p>- Parking breeds autos.</p>

        <p>- People should be encouraged to take public transportation and discouraged to drive.</p>

        <p>- He would like to limit the residential parking to 1 to 4 and require that the parking be underground.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Cheryl Brinkman - Walk San Francisco</b></p>

        <p>- There are a large number of people who would prefer to walk if the area was safer.</p>

        <p>- The blank walls in the existing alley will be very dangerous.</p>

        <p>- They have been working very hard to encourage people to walk.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Commission should be working with them to increase the safety of the area.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Leah Shahum - - San Francisco Bicycle Coalition</b></p>

        <p>- Their offices are located near the area where the project is being proposed.</p>

        <p>- Bike and pedestrian conditions are being improved.</p>

        <p>- They oppose the parking proposal.</p>

        <p><b>(-) Howard Strassner - Sierra Club</b></p>

        <p>- The Sierra Club opposes the parking garage.</p>

        <p>- This parking garage is not necessary so the Commission should oppose it.</p>

        <p><b>(-) David Wilbur - Mid-Market PAC</b></p>

        <p>- He thanked the developers for coming to the mid-Market PAC to present this project.</p>

        <p>- It is true that an entertainment district is being planned. But a garage would only cause a lot of congestion.</p>

        <p>- Comb the streets; add cafes, bars, restaurants, etc is what needs to be done instead to revitalize the area.</p>

        <p><b>(-) David Snyder - Transportation for a Livable City</b></p>

        <p>- There are various organizations that are opposing the parking garage.</p>

        <p>- He requested that the Commission deny this conditional use.</p>

        <p>- The reason why the parking demand has not been demonstrated is because the parking garages are not being used to their entirety and car-pooling has not been taken into account.</p>

        <p>- This commission should not approve this project until there is a thorough analysis of a multi livable system</p>

        <p><b>(-) Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- The parking garages around the City are very unpleasant to walk by.</p>

        <p>- The issue of parking is very huge.</p>

        <p>- No one is opposing the housing aspect of this project.  Everyone is only opposing the parking.</p>

        <p>- This project will deaden the area.</p>

    <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  None:  Informational Presentation</p>

        <ul><ul><p><b>Rick Kaufman - City Core Development</b></p>

        <p>- 333 Fremont Street is a project he is working on.</p>

        <p>- The projects that have been applied for already should not be &quot;held hostage&quot; as the City finds a way to act.</p>

        <p>- The housing crisis is clear.  He requests that the Commission do what is best to move these projects along swiftly.</p>

        <p>- It is important to have communication between the Commission, the Department and the Public.</p>

        <p>- He has never seen a model of how increasing the cost of building homes is going to provide affordable housing.</p>

        <p><b>Debra Stein</b></p>

        <p>- She commended staff on their vision of the neighborhood on a micro level.</p>

        <p>- Action needs to be taken today and guidance provided to staff in order to apply the policies that the Commission wants to establish.</p>

        <p>- There should be a more realistic housing plan.</p>

        <p>- There is a suggestion that the view protection plan will assure the creation of a 40 to 60 foot height towers.</p>

        <p>- Housing optimization plan is more important than this view protection plan.</p>

        <p><b>Rev. Arnold Townsend</b></p>

        <p>- In this plan any off site affordable housing that is created in Rincon can only be used in Rincon.</p>

        <p>- It is difficult to find inexpensive land in the Rincon Hill area.</p>

        <p>- It is important to do off site housing.</p>

        <p>- If housing is built in Rincon, all of San Francisco should benefit.</p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission to direct staff to rethink this issue.</p>

        <p>- Every onramp to Freeways start in SOMA.</p>

        <p><b>Trevor Boddy</b></p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission to reconsider all current development applications in the Rincon area.</p>

        <p>- It is important to very carefully examine the schemes.</p>

        <p><b>James Haas - Transbay CAC</b></p>

        <p>- He has been involved in the Rincon community for many years.</p>

        <p>- The whole motivation started on what to do with the old bus station.</p>

        <p>- The issues of financing and what the terminal will look like are still things to look at.</p>

        <p>- There is still a lot of Planning to do and the public or the Commission should not rush into things.</p>

        <p><b>Gabriel Metcalf</b></p>

        <p>- The staff has done incredible urban planning design work.</p>

        <p>- He is in favor of putting the urban design goal and balancing that with the housing design goals.</p>

        <p>- This area is an incredible place to put housing.</p>

        <p>- It is irresponsible to put forward exactions without really analyzing and studying the fees.</p>

        <p>- It is important to be extremely cautions.</p>

        <p><b>David White - SPUR</b></p>

        <p>- He was hired to do a neighborhood needs assessment.</p>

        <p>- There are still a lot of issues that need to be studied before this plan can be put forward.</p>

        <p>- He will be working with various companies to prepare this assessment.</p>

        <p><b>Steve Wilson, attorney - representing Archdiocese of San Francisco</b></p>

        <p>- He is working on a project at 99 Fremont Street.</p>

        <p>- They have taken a quantum leap on this plan but there is still much more that is needed.</p>

        <p>- He asks that the Commission give staff more direction.</p>

        <p>- The housing is the most important aspect and what the City really needs.</p>

        <p>- The plan collides with government code 53313.</p>

        <p><b>Ron Carlson - RC &amp; Associates</b></p>

        <p>- The area is not appropriate for such tall projects.</p>

        <p>- He is a native San Franciscan and there are a lot of differences between Vancouver and San Francisco.</p>

        <p><b>Lu Blazej</b></p>

        <p>- He displayed a document:  &quot;Existing Height and Bulk Districts&quot; explaining how he did not understand why this document was not provided to the Commissioners.</p>

        <p>- He urged staff to do a plan that would optimize more housing in the area.</p>

        <p><b>Clark Manus, Architect</b></p>

        <p>- He commended staff on a very well put together document but with serious flaws.</p>

        <p>- The presentation actually did not provide him with the information that is in the document.</p>

        <p>- He lives in the real world so there are issues that still needs to be dealt with.</p>

        <p>- Mixed Use is what the public wants to see here.</p>

        <p>- One of the things that the department has failed to do is [consider] the dynamics regarding high rise residential buildings.</p>

        <p>- He does not dispute the department's desire to promote tower separations.</p>

        <p>- Section 270 and 271 cannot be applied.</p>

        <p><b>Roger Brandon</b></p>

        <p>- The area is not a neighborhood, but is part of the downtown business area.</p>

        <p>- What kind of people want to live in residential towers in the downtown area?</p>

        <p>- This is the densest plan in the City.</p>

        <p>- This is all a bad idea.</p>

        <p>- This project should not be passed.</p>

        <p><b>Dick Millet</b></p>

        <p>- He is opposed to the 200-foot height limit.</p>

        <p>- He is having trouble with obtaining the information from the department.  He is getting information from the newspapers.</p>

        <p>- There are plenty of other areas to build these type of things.</p>

        <p><b>Kelly Dearman</b></p>

        <p>- She has been trying to get people qualified to purchase units from <s>a 20-unit building</s> <u>20 units</u> in the Bay View.</p>

        <p>- People are excited to purchase units in their own neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- If developers continue to have the option of off-site, affordable housing will be built in various neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- She urges the Commission to direct staff to continue to build off site housing.</p>

        <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>

        <p>- She reminded the Commission that there are two presentations from staff.</p>

        <p>- The spacing between the towers should be large.</p>

        <p>- The Commission needs to direct staff that the public needs independent full urban design information.</p>

        <p>- The public would go to the Board of Supervisors with the Commission to request money to be able to have these studies done.</p>

        <p><b>Tim Tosta</b></p>

        <p>- He presented a study from the City of San Jose regarding economic development.</p>

        <p>- It would be misleading that the Redevelopment Agency and  Planning are closely working together.</p>

        <p>- There are a number of issues here that still need to be dealt with.</p>

        <p><b>Calvin Welsh</b></p>

        <p>- The principal need in San Francisco is for affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- It is important to house the projected work force.</p>

        <p>- The economic and social realty needs to be analyzed.</p>

        <p>- Staff has been silent on the issue of affordability.</p>

        <p>- The need is for affordable housing and not just housing.</p>

        <p>- There is some great discussion that the staff recommendation for this area is a public benefit fee.</p>

        <p>- A fee is absolutely critical.</p>

        <p><b>Theodore Brown</b></p>

        <p>- He has been working on a project on Fremont Street for two years.</p>

        <p>- Everything required for this project has been filed.  Now with this plan, everything has been changed on him.</p>

        <p><b>Joe O'Donaghue</b></p>

        <p>- Everything needs to be analyzed together and there is no financial analysis or model and this is essential.</p>

        <p>- The cost of concrete construction is now cheaper than that of frame construction.  The cost of plywood has doubled.</p>

        <p>- A lot more data is needed as well as a comprehensive plan.</p>

        <p><b>Steve Vettel</b></p>

        <p>- He commended staff on a very good plan.</p>

        <p>- All the comments heard here today should be incorporated into the report.</p>

        <p>- At the Bank of America site there are two towers being proposed. </p>

        <p>- In order to do this, the building will have to be demolished.  One thing that surprised him is that there is mention of preserving the tower.  There cannot be a planned unit development if the tower is intended to be preserved.</p>

        <p><b>Bob Meyers</b></p>

        <p>- He urges the support of the 80-foot tower separation and the 250-foot height limit.</p>

        <p>- He strongly opposes the staff's preferred option.</p>

        <p>- Rincon is not Transbay and it is especially not Vancouver.</p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission to support reality.</p>

        <p><b>Marilyn Amini</b></p>

        <p>- The Commission has already approved two projects that are not in conformance with the plan being presented.</p>

        <p>- She asks that the Commission reconsider the decision on the Folsom and Spear Street project.</p>

        <p>- It is important to do an environmental review for this area.</p>

This is the third and final public hearing on the proposed Guidelines to provide the Planning Commission with all modifications made to the Guidelines after receiving comments and recommendations from the public and the Planning Commission at the May 22, 2003 and the October 23, 2003 hearings, and at follow up meetings held by Department staff with the public. </p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Adopt the draft version of the December 2003 Residential Design Guidelines as policy.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><b>Jerry Lax</b></p>

        <p>- He has worked in San Francisco for 24 years.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about some of the limitations associated with the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- The projects that he has worked on over the years would not meet the guidelines being proposed.</p>

        <p>- He has met with staff and staff has integrated a setback, which he has applied to his projects.</p>

        <p><b>Ron Miguel</b></p>

        <p>- He has commented before on the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

        <p>- There were two comments made today regarding the manner in which the residential design guidelines are being handled throughout the department.  One is that clarity and consistency are very important.  The other is that he was please that the guidelines will not be instituted immediately in order to give time for training of staff.</p>

        <p>- Many times there is confusion with the public because of the interpretation from staff when there is no consistency.</p>

        <p>- It is important that staff learn how to interpret them so that the public knows where they stand at all times.</p>

        <p><b>John Slessinger - American Institute of Architects</b></p>

        <p>- The idea behind the letter he submitted is just to suggest friendly amendments in future hearings regarding the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- They have reviewed the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- Some of the most important items to consider are that the Commission and staff recognized that there will be items that will come back during future hearings.  There isn't enough information regarding solar access and solar collectors.  He urges the Commission to direct staff to obtain a companion piece to the guidelines for zoning regulations on this.</p>

        <p>- Also, the issue of height and bulk needs to be clear.</p>

        <p><b>Marilyn Amini</b></p>

        <p>- She requested that the Commission not take an action today because it was not available until last Monday.</p>

        <p>- The resolution that is before the Commission states that the guidelines will be required in the project design and community response process.  Also the Planning Executive Summary states that there are new issues that need to be addressed.</p>

        <p>- The public needs more time to have an opportunity to respond.</p>

        <p>- The resolution also has a date of today, but the hearing is just happening.</p>

        <p>- If the guidelines were made more specific, it would help planners to solve disagreements.</p>
