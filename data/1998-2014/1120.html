The project includes approximately 86 on-site below-ground parking spaces.  The project also would seismically upgrade St. Mark's Lutheran Church and relocate about 5,000 square feet of social services space from the Urban Life Center building to the adjacent Martin Luther Tower.  The 80,400-square-foot site is located in an RM-4 (Residential, Mixed: High Density) Zoning District within the Western Addition neighborhood.

Such policies and procedures for these two community plan areas would be necessary after the expiration of the IPZ Interim Controls on August 5, 2001, and would remain in effect until permanent controls are adopted.<br>Action: Non Action Item. Public comment and Commission deliberation only.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEAKER(S):<br>(+) Kepa Askenasy, Potrero Hill<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complimented the Planning Department on the work done so far<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Asked the Commission to support the Planning Director on reaching out to their community<br>(+) Julie Milburn, member of 7th Street Commercial Street Association<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has been working long and hard with the people of Dogpatch.  We have achieved a high level of consensus about what the feelings are and how we'd like to go ahead.  We are thinking very much along the same lines.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For our area, at the bottom of Potrero Hill, we feel that imposing interim controls is very unnecessary. <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we lack and what we need is some oversight.  We know our community; we know exactly what traffic controls should be.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term business members have come and stated that with the development in Mission Bay, portions of our area are going to change in years to come.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need professional planning.  We need someone who is going to listen to us about what we need<br>(+) Bob Meyers<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Plan for South of Market identifies SLI areas as the only areas where housing is allowed&ndash;low income housing.  Since 1989, when the plan was adopted, as far as experts can tell, not one unit of low income housing has been built.<br>(+) Jim Chappell, President of SPUR<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referred to a letter sent to the Commission about extensive dialogues on this subject with the Department for a number of years.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had serious reservations about this policy in general. This resolution before you today, in particular, is very inflexible.  We have no greater need in San Francisco today than housing.  There are no shortages of places to work or places to rent for work in the City, but there are certainly shortages of places to live.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The map shown called  Housing Opportunity Areas  presented by the Department should be called the  Fantasy Map. <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This resolution gives every benefit-of-the-doubt to PDR, and really penalizes housing.

With this policy, you will have the flexibility and the ability because all of these sites are currently zoned NR-2.  So, any residential project of one unit and above is going to require a conditional use permit.  You will then have the opportunity to consider all the impact of that project, including the impact it might have on PDR.<br>(+) Steve Kuklin<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Applicant for the 601 King Street Project<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believes that there are many properties that may be appropriate for residential development within this protective IPZ zone<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding 601 King, we have been trying to developed that site for the last 2 years as an office and residential project<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The 601 King Street property is located between Mission Bay on right and Shipley Square on the left.

This Commission already had a policy that said no housing and no office south of Cesar Chavez.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;90% of this area is industrial and (the community) said that we do not want housing there.  <br>(+) Andrew Junius<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically commenting on the SOMA Community Plan Area.  The proposed controls, specifically the third bullet point that says  discourage office development for conversions that are not permitted as a principal use as per the base SOMA zoning district. <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called to attention a not very well used portion of the Planning Code, Section 803.5.  This is a section that allows office space in historic landmark buildings where the underline zoning would not. It is a way of allowing a historic building to have a little more flexibility to obtain tenants and to allow the building to be preserved. This affects a very small number of buildings in the South of Market area, but it is a very important way to insure that these historic buildings have a little more flexibility to maintain their premises and maintain the historic structure.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopes that this policy does not conflict with that.  It is also well understood that this small number of building would be able to take advantage of that Section of the Planning Code.<br>(-) Dick Millett<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the 601 King Street Building:  This type of building is designed to be turned down.  The warehouses on the Showplace are design differently, but the Buttler buildings are expandable.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Land use is something else.

It was dropped in part because your staff, conducted a very lengthy site visit and saw the conditions of these buildings and the conditions of the retaining walls.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the association with the earthquake in 1907--most of San Francisco in the northeast area was rebuilt after the earthquake because it was burned.  That alone cannot establish any significance.  Secondly, in terms of the history--relying on an association with Mary Hartwell, yes, she was good, but that does not make the building that she lived in of landmark quality or establish the kind of significant contributions that warrant that link.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your staff asked the author and supporter for additional information, nothing was forthcoming.

The proposal is to construct two single-family dwellings, one on each of the existing vacant lots, under Building Permit Application Nos. 9805710&rsquo;S&rsquo; and 9805711&rsquo;S&rsquo;. The subject property is in an RH-1 (D) (Residential, House, Detached Dwellings) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.<br>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary Review and approve the project as submitted.<br><br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEAKER(S):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+) Tim Colen, President, Edgehill Neighborhood Association<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is really a bad project.  This is a highly unusual case and there are there many reasons why, even until now, these lots have not been developed.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This meeting is an exact repetition of the Landmark hearing.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer took the case to the Board of Appeals and lost. <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The developer said that the Planning Commission did not have the discretionary power to turn down a project that met zoning laws and building codes.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What this case proved is that the Commission can turn down a residential development if it is determined that the project is unsuitable for the location.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing has change on Edgehill except for 2 landslides--one a massive land failure in 1997 only 15 feet away from this project site; which is 50 feet away from one of our neighbors home that was condemned and demolished only 4 years ago.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are some of the project's flaws: 1) it's been repeatedly proven that this site sits on some of the most geologicly (unstable) land in the Bay Area; there is a long history of landslides in the area, all of them related to human alterations of the slopes and vegetation.  Additional geological sheer zones were documented during an investigation of the site.  In spite of these no further investigation was required.  2) The developer argues that this project has been approved by the City Structural Advisory Committee (SAC), but what SAC determined was ignored.  What SAC found was the project simply met the building codes and that is all.  In addition, SAC only reviewed within the boundaries of the two subject lots, there has been no review whatsoever of the surrounding area including the street or adjacent properties, safety issues outside of these lots has simply not been considered.  3) There should be no illusions here.  How many homes are being considered here today?  We documented that this is a 5 lot, 6 home project.  The developer intends to build 2 homes at a time in order to evade the requirements of CEQA and other requirements.  We call this illegal serial development.  4) Edgehill Way has very unusual liability characteristics; it is a dedicated non-accepted (street).  In fact, it is a private street.  We are facing a situation where approval is being considered for structures to be build on (the) cliff, in an area known to have repeatedly had slope failures. Yet the City has repeatedly denied any responsibility for this street.  5) This developer proposes to widen a 10 foot wide street by 4 feet. This will be a large complex construction project in and of itself, involving more drilling and excavating deep into these steeps slopes.  We were told that the proposed widening would provide both improved emergency vehicle access and additional street parking.  We think that is physically impossible and is dangerous to our neighborhood.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged the Commission to determine that this is not a sensible project for this neighborhood or for the City itself.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+) Neil Eisenberg<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a serial development.  That means when you are looking at the design of these two houses, you are doing so out of context with the other 4 homes that will be developed.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the absence on having the total picture before you, it is hard for you to say that this is in character with the neighborhood.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, the geological information that we have received so far is inadequate.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, these homes are proposed to bet 5500 square feet--triple the size of the adjacent homes.  They are out of proportion with the neighborhood.  And who knows how the other 4 home are going to be designed in the future.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The City's policies specifically provide for open space. The design question is what (open space) can you see from the area?<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our office has been the attorney for Edgehill Way for two years, yet we had never heard from the developer with respect to a compromise on the design.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a classic case where you should take Discretionary Review.  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+) Darren Van Hoff, Senior Engineer, Nino and Moore, Geotechnical Consultant<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have been involved with this project since September 1988.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reviewed the documents that the developer has provided and have been given the opportunity to observe the large diameter borings that were lodged down the hole.  Were also at the site and recognized the conditions out there.  On the large diameter borings we noticed that there were sheer zones filled with clay--sheer zones that are similar to the one that caused landslides in the past.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (+) Howard Ellman, Attorney, representing Dr. and Mrs. Bruce Albert <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They live directly across the street from the proposed project.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of their consternation and connection with this project builds on a point that Mr. Eisenberg made--the road improvement, which is an intergrowth of this project, which is required.  In order for this project to go forward, it must be considered in connection with this application.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was originally designed with tight backs that encroached on the Albert's property.  That design was just presented to DPW.  It was then discovered that (earlier information was inaccurate and the new was) not given to the Albert's.  When they discovered this, they called attention to the fact there was an encroachment.  The initial response from the developer was that there was no encroachment. When it was discovered, he agreed to pull back and to a redesign.  The redesign was filed with the Planning Department last week and has just been reviewed by the geotechnical people.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even though the original proposal said that the original tight backs were required for structural safety, those tight backs have been significantly reduced.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+) Jerry Klein<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was a member of the Planning Commission on January 14, 1992, when this project came before the Planning Commission.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In no way can he be characterized as anti-development.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When this project came to us, there were signs that this was a very dangerous site, lacking proper access, landslides, just not a proper site for development.  The Commission then voted unanimously to require the Zoning Administrator to review the cumulative effects of any development and to record our (concerns) and require a full EIR<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site is not appropriate for development.

Edgehill Mountain is a fragile area, particularly on the western and southern slopes of the hill.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The development of 3 homes on Kensington Way approximately 200 feet below the site, was nearly a disaster because of the excessive excavation of the hill site, which required the construction of an emergency containment wall some 50 feet high to contain and secure the hill site.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (+) Bob Passmore<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The neighborhood association requested that I appear before you because I worked for the Department from 1960 until two years ago.

It is essentially the same height, the same size, (and) the same number of bedrooms that are been proposed.  It has basically improved in terms of the visual appearance.  The problems that existed at the time the Planning Commission thought that this project was inappropriate are not different.  In fact, there is more information for the Planning Commission to be concerned, with because of the mudslides that occurred in 1997.  The developers for the project on Kensington Way did not anticipate the landslide.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the material before you, there are various elements to this project that you do not have sufficient information on.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Geotechnical materials are not as complete as they should be because of the problems of encroachment with the adjacent property.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are issues of how well the traffic will work during construction.

At a minimum we are going to have more cars blocking access.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The area where this project is proposed to be built is the narrowest road and there is absolutely no room for any parking.
