The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001.0535E &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                  (B.WYCKO: (415) 558-5972)<br>724-730 VAN NESS AVENUE - Appeal of Preliminary Negative Declaration. The proposed project involves the demolition of two existing one-story buildings at 724-730 Van Ness Avenue and 650-660 Turk Street, and the construction of a new building consisting of an approximately 130-foot tall, 14-story tower fronting on Van Ness Avenue and a 67-foot tall, 7-story tower fronting on Turk Street above a two-level subsurface parking garage and ground floor retail space, accessory office and recreation/laundry room.  The project site is located on Lots 4 and 8 in Assessor's Block 742.  The vacant 724 Van Ness Avenue building was formerly occupied by about 4,500 square feet of retail space. At  730 Van Ness Avenue, there currently exists about 1,500 square feet of restaurant space.  The existing structure at 650-660 Turk contains 9,750 square feet and is currently occupied by an auto repair business at street level and an auto glass repair shop at the mezzanine level.  The new building would consist of about 134 dwelling units on floor levels 2 through 14 with lobby access from Van Ness Avenue, 45 independently-accessible parking spaces for the dwelling units on two parking levels with vehicular access from Turk Street, and ground floor space allocated to an approximately 1,530 square foot community/laundry room, about 830 square feet of office space accessory to the residential complex, and about 2,200 square feet of retail space.  Both project site lots are within a RC-4 District (Residential-Commercial Combined District, High-Density District) and the Van Ness Avenue Special Use District (SUD) as well as a 130-V Height and Bulk District.  The project would require Conditional Use authorization for new construction over 40 feet in height. The project sponsor would also need to seek Variances regarding off-street parking and loading requirements and for the height of of the mechanical penthouse on the tower which fronts Van Ness Avenue.<br>(Continued from Regular Meeting of March 21, 2002)<br>(Proposed for continuance to May 23, 2002)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to May 23, 2002<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoharis<br><br>2a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001.1027CR&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;                (G.
