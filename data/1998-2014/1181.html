      <ul><ul><ul><p>7.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>Re:  690 Market Street</p>

        <p>- He read in the Chronicle that this project was having some difficulty</p>

        <p>- This is one of his favorite projects because it provides so many good things.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that this project will begin a process of improving the mid-Market area.</p>

        <p>- When the case came before the Commission, the Mills act was not applicable to the project.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that all people involved would work together and make this project happen.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

        <p>Re:  755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue</p>

        <p>- There was some confusion about this project.</p>

        <p>- She wanted to get some clarity.</p>

          <ul><p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner Responded:</i></p>

          <p>- He sent out emails regarding a conversation with Steve Williams.</p>

          <p>- There was a request that if this was still at the Planning Department, it could come back.</p>

          <p>- He felt that certainty was required.  He has determined that it was not appropriate to bring the project back since it is not in the Planning Department.</p>

        </ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- He would like to know from the City Attorney if whether or not a project is code compliant it takes an affirmative majority vote for it to proceed?</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">City Attorney Judy Boyajian Responded:</font></p>

          <p>- The way the Commission, staff and the City Attorney have interpreted the Commission's procedures is that whoever needs the vote to move forward and they don't get it then they loose.</p>

          <p>- If a Conditional Use approval is needed and it is a failed motion then the CU is not approved.</p>

          <p>- If there is a need to take Discretionary Review over a code complying project and it fails to get four votes, the project moves forward because the Commission has not taken DR.</p>

          <p>- If the project has left the department, does the Commission have the legal ability to call the project back?  She cannot say that the Commission cannot call it back.  If the permits have already been issued, then the Commission has lost it's jurisdiction.  But if it is still not issued and it is over in DBI and the Commission wants to call it back, the Commission has that legal authority.  </p>

        <p>- If the Commission requests the Building Inspection Commission to return this project are they within the legal parameters to do that?</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">City Attorney Judy Boyajian Responded:</font></p>

          <p>- The Commission would not be asking the Building Inspection Commission, it would be asking the Department of Building Inspection.</p>

        <p>- He requested to schedule on next week's calendar the project at 755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue to be reconsidered by the Commission and discuss the options.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commission Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- There is no consensus to bring this project back.</p>

        <p>- There have been several cases similar to this one.  The Commission cannot keep bringing back projects.</p>

        <p>- When the case was heard and there was consensus about continuing the project, then it would have been continued.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>- If there were consensus to bring a case back there would be a need for four votes.</p>

        <p>- The only time a case should be brought back is when a case is badly misrepresented or something was not done procedurally.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner S. Lee:</font></p>

        <p>- Bringing cases back would be opening a &quot;Pandora's Box.&quot;</p>

        <p>- If something like this is going to keep happening in the future then the Commission needs to be clear on the rules and it should be done in a timely manner.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Interim Director Macris:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Supervisor Maxwell's Interim Controls for the Showplace Square</i></p>

        <p>- Staff has been following this legislation.</p>

        <p>- A hearing was held last week on the value of the interim controls.</p>

        <p>- From the Department's point of view, since the controls do not come back to the Commission, the Department's interests were what the interim controls were tied to in terms of time before the Board of Supervisors considers them again.</p>

        <p>- The interim controls were pending the completion of the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR.</p>

        <p>- By the draft ordinance it would be within one year.  This would be impractical.</p>

        <p>- He has offered some alternative ways to the Supervisor and it is under consideration.</p>

        <p>- The Land Use Committee could not act on the matter but it will act on the Interim Controls on December 6 and go to the Full Board.</p>

        <p>- He did not want the Supervisor to think that in any way the interim controls could be extended 6 months.  It is not a practical idea to tie this to the EIR.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Backlogs</i></p>

        <p>- He is please to say that interviews for the Planner III-Environmental position have been underway.</p>

        <p>- He hopes to make a decision by the end of this year.</p>

        <p>- Interviews were also held for the Chief Financial Officer.  He hopes to have someone by the end of the year.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  2404 Broadway</i></p>

        <p>- This project is an alteration of an existing building.</p>

        <p>- A few months ago there was an appeal.</p>

        <p>- Staff has been working with the Project Sponsor to understand more of the details of the project.</p>

        <p>- The project Sponsor was to send drawings but they did not reflect what had been discussed.</p>

        <p>- Staff and MEA determined that the Categorical Exemption had some weaknesses.</p>

        <p>- They decided it was best to issue a new Categorical Exception.</p>

        <p>- The actual item then will not go before the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p>- There was not any desire to circumvent the project but staff just wanted the best information before appearing at the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p>- The Board of Supervisors was upset, but it is best to get the best information.</p>

        <p>- There was no intent to cut anyone out of the process.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- It has been presented to him that some projects have not come before the commission because there is no knowledge of whether controls or proposals will be approved.</p>

        <p>- He feels that projects should move forward at whatever speed is normal and they should not be held up pending this decision.</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Interim Director Macris Responded:</font></p>

          <p>- He agrees that if a project comes legitimately before the Planning Department and meets the environmental clearances then they should be heard.</p>

          <p>- Certain steps should be taken to establish policy and not have to wait two years to have firm ground consensus on how to proceed on this situation.</p>

          <p>- How can interim policy consensus be developed to move forward pending completion of the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR?</p>

          <p>- The City cannot hold out two years.</p>

        <p><u>RINCON HILL PLAN</u> - <font class="heading2">Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report</font>.<font class="heading2">  </font>The proposed project is a revised Rincon Hill Plan (an Area Plan of the San Francisco General Plan) and revised planning controls for the Rincon Hill area. The San Francisco Planning Department proposes to replace the Planning Code's existing Rincon Hill Special Use District (SUD), as set out in Planning Code Section 249.1, with a new Rincon Hill Downtown Residential Mixed Use District (DTR), which would increase height limits, revise the &quot;R&quot; bulk district, amend the Rincon Hill Area Plan, and make other General Plan and zoning changes intended to stimulate additional high-density, residential development in the Rincon Hill area. Improvements to the streetscape, transportation system and open space would result from implementation of the new Plan. Rincon Hill is in the northeast section of San Francisco, south of the Financial District and Transbay Terminal, and north of the South Beach neighborhood.  The project area is bounded generally by Folsom Street, Steuart Street, The Embarcadero, Bryant Street, the Bay Bridge approach and the Transbay Terminal ramps and encompasses about 12 city blocks. </p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Hold Public Hearing. No action required.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Ken Werner - Trinity Plaza Tenants Association</font></p>

        <p>- He asked the Commission to reconsider this plan because it does not offer low income housing.</p>

        <p>- This is unacceptable to the people of SOMA.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">James Collins</font></p>

        <p>- He asked the Commission to reconsider this proposal.</p>

        <p>- This project does not have low income housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Richard Marquez - Mission Agenda</font></p>

        <p>- Rincon Hill is returning to its roots of exclusivity of class and social segregation.</p>

        <p>- What other project will accompany this type of project?</p>

        <p>- Why is the Department &quot;Vancouverizing&quot; San Francisco?</p>

        <p>- This project puts affordable housing &quot;out of sight.&quot;</p>

        <p>- He requested that the Commission fight for San Francisco's affordable future.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Dustin Dun - Mission Agenda</font></p>

        <p>- Forcing people out of housing that they can afford is terrible.</p>

        <p>- There is too much disparity here.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Stephen Wilson - Archdiocese of San Francisco</font></p>

        <p>- This DEIR fails on various counts:  1) it limits the Commission's range of actions; 2) it is inadequate because the alternative selected and analyzed limits the range of actions and decisions possible by the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors; 3) it limits housing production; 4) it does not meet Proposition M; 5) there has been a defacto moratorium and this should be stopped; 6) there is a more aggressive and better way to develop projects.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Commission should direct staff to develop and analyze an alternative project that fits within the proposed Rincon Hill height limits.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Lucian Blazej</font></p>

        <p>- The draft EIR only provides for 2,100 units and there could be more.</p>

        <p>- This draft EIR should provide the community the information to broadly evaluate the various plans and zoning controls to optimize housing.  It does not do this.</p>

        <p>- The EIR does not have an economic analysis.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Maurice Healy - Archdiocese of San Francisco</font></p>

        <p>- There is a loss of housing with this project.</p>

        <p>- Under current zoning this project could provide more housing units.</p>

        <p>- Taller buildings would be more expensive to build.</p>

        <p>- An alternative should be proposed that optimizes housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Bob Meyers</font></p>

        <p>- Staff's preferred option is flawed in this EIR.</p>

        <p>- The plan does not increase housing production.</p>

        <p>- Most Rincon Heights are already built.</p>

        <p>- The few remaining housing sites are not much.</p>

        <p>- Housing is more important than tower separation.</p>

        <p>- An addendum can be issued for public comment.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Alison Poole</font></p>

        <p>- The DEIR does not contain any information that super housing could be afforded by real people.</p>

        <p>- This draft EIR is defective.</p>

        <p>- Almost every EIR has an economic analysis and this one does not have it.</p>

        <p>- A comprehensive study should be made before building these fantasy towers.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Aaron Poser</font></p>

        <p>- The Draft EIR is based on false assumptions.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Debra Stein</font></p>

        <p>- Preservation of views and blue sky seems to be more important than housing in this EIR.</p>

        <p>- The maximum housing option should be the preferred option and not the option that the department suggests.</p>

        <p>- It is important that this EIR acknowledge that there are projects that are moving forward.</p>

        <p>- This current building is not a historic resource as the EIR states.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Collin Mazza</font></p>

        <p>- 375 Fremont should be evaluated as proposed under current zoning.</p>

        <p>- There are various projects that have been in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>- 375 Fremont is consistent with the Rincon Hill Plan.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Eleanor Killebrew - BrownBrew</font></p>

        <p>- The Rincon Hill area is within walking distance of downtown and public transportation.</p>

        <p>- None of the proposed plans include open space areas.</p>

        <p>- Proposed high-rise projects would not displace anyone.</p>

        <p>- Maximizing the number of high-rises and housing is a good idea.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Theodore Brown - BrownBrew</font></p>

        <p>- He is for the tower separation in order to optimize housing.</p>

        <p>- Rincon Hill is a good place for housing because it is close to the proposed Transbay Terminal.</p>

        <p>- Density optimizes fiscal efficiency and utilization of expensive infrastructure.</p>

        <p>- The proposed project would not have any negative effect on current utilities.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Calvin Welsh - Council for Community Housing Organizations</font></p>

        <p>- The Draft EIR is in need of amendments because it is incomplete and fails to address the range of environmental impacts of the proposed project.</p>

        <p>- The EIR draws too narrow a focus.</p>

        <p>- It fails to look at the SOMA community in both housing and traffic, especially for families and seniors.</p>

        <p>- The definition of the setting of the plan tends to ignore the impact of dismissing the recently approved Housing Element.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Chris Durazo - South of Market Community Action Network</font></p>

        <p>- The EIR should be amended.</p>

        <p>- She feels that the scope is inaccurate.  It looks like spot zoning.</p>

        <p>- This is an EIR for rezoning and not for a specific project.</p>

        <p>- The Housing Element that was approved should be included.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">April Veneracion - South of Market Community Action Network</font></p>

        <p>- The Draft EIR is inaccurate and does not effectively address the long-range impacts of maximum density on the socio economic well being of the South of Market residents and workers.</p>

        <p>- The Draft EIR is incomplete in scope.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Rajiv Bhatia - San Francisco DPH</font></p>

        <p>- There are ways that the EIR can fully analyze the impacts.</p>

        <p>- People have spoken about increased density so more housing should be built.</p>

        <p>- There are imbalances between jobs and housing.</p>

        <p>- There is no school plans on the site.</p>

        <p>- The new workers would not be able to live at this location.</p>

        <p>- Also, there is an assumption that lower income people drive less.</p>

        <p>- There are too many assumptions in the EIR.</p>

        <p>- The plan needs a more complete analysis of jobs and housing.</p>

        <p>- The Metropolitan Commission could provide more ideas.</p>

        <p>- This project needs to be looked at in a citywide perspective.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Julia Dimaio - Senior Action Network and Senior Housing Action</font></p>

        <p>- Seniors are in desperate need of housing but they are concerned about the amounts the units would be sold for.</p>

        <p>- The Rincon Hill Plan does not attend the needs of the community, families with children or seniors.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Charles Stewart - SOMECAN</font></p>

        <p>- He does not support the DEIR for the Rincon Hill Plan.  It is very unreasonable.</p>

        <p>- This project is wiping the residents of the south of market out of the area.</p>

        <p>- The Rincon Hill plan will not be community friendly.</p>

        <p>- He requests that the EIR be redone to focus more on the community.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Angelica Cabande - SOMECAN</font></p>

        <p>- Every day she speaks to tenants in the South of Market area and they are concerned with the difficulty of displacement, affordability, etc.</p>

        <p>- How will the Rincon Hill plan focus on the community?</p>

        <p>- An EIR should be done that mitigates the negative impacts the zoning changes will create.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Ron Calson</font></p>

        <p>- The preferred option has many negative aspects.  It is not community focused and should not include the projects that are in the pipeline.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Commission should be informed on the economic impacts of the housing costs, neighborhood parking, and the housing markets likely to be served when major zoning changes are proposed.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Azalia Merrel - Carpenter's Union</font></p>

        <p>- She is concerned over her &quot;cozzy&quot; rent controlled apartment of seven years.</p>

        <p>- She would not be able to afford the million dollar condos that are on the market.</p>

        <p>- This is another project that started under one set of rules and has continued with another set of rules.</p>

        <p>- She is not opposed to the super towers but has concerns about their affordability.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Robert McCarthy - McCarthy and Swartz</font></p>

        <p>- The preferred choice of staff would result in less units, less tax revenues, eliminate construction jobs, etc.</p>

        <p>- This plan is the greatest &quot;power grab&quot; in history.</p>

        <p>- The Commission needs to preserve their discretion.</p>
