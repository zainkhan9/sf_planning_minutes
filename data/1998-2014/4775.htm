<P><FONT FACE="Arial">		PUBLIC NOTICE AMENDMENT - Consideration of a proposal to amend the
Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 306 to require the
Director of Planning to provide to any person who has requested in writing,
notice of actions to be taken pursuant to the Planning Code or State law. 
Currently, various sections of the Planning Code require a newspaper notice of
public hearings before the Planning Commission or the Zoning Administrator for
various actions to be taken by these bodies.  In cases where the action would
affect a particular site or area, a mailed notice is required to be sent to owners
of the subject site or area and of surrounding properties.  Though not a legal
requirement, notices regarding matters that are not site specific are also sent to
parties known to be interested in the issue.  This amendment would also require
that a notice be sent to any person who has submitted a written request to be
notified and would prohibit the Department from charging a fee to cover its
expenses for postage and maintaining the notification records. Testimony and
Commission considerations could result in recommendations of modifications to
the proposed legislation.</FONT></P>

Impact Report (FSEIR).   The project is the proposed adoption of two Redevelopment Plans and
establishment of two Redevelopment Areas (Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South) and
associated documents and actions to develop an urban mixed-use community consisting of
residential, commercial, light industrial, educational (a major new University of California San
Francisco site), and open space uses, with supporting infrastructure (including new streets and
sewers), community facilities, and other public improvements.  The proposed project would be
located on approximately 303 acres located generally south of Townsend Street, east of
Seventh Street and I-280 freeway, and north of Mariposa Street. </FONT></P>
