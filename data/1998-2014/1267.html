<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The cover page had interesting findings.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Perhaps Dr. Ghosh could answer.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The second part says that almost 800 new affordable units were constructed.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I'm assuming that is part of the 1,870.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">That is over 40% of the units we built were affordable.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The housing was in the eastern part of the city.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I guess what I question is in terms of the 2660 Harrison situation where we have a moratorium on projects; if in fact one of the parts of this action is the fact that the type of housing being built is not reflective of the population.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It seems that is not the case in 2005.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Based upon the statistic, it seems like that is not a valid assertion.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I wanted to raise that point and perhaps Dr. Ghosh could comment.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">But in the main, we have been producing the same proportion of affordable housing for a long period of time &ndash; about 25%.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Since we are producing more overall housing, the number of affordable housing is also larger.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I watched the Land Use Committee yesterday.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">The discussion on the Eastern Neighborhoods was, I thought, pretty & </span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I have a concern for us as commissioners.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">There is a disconnect with what the public is feeling and where the department is or isn't able to fulfill in terms of certain area plans and what not.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">So after seeing it, I think that it is important that we do have the opportunity to hear them &ndash; the Eastern Neighborhoods resolution I believe Supervisor Maxwell offered.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">One of the questions I had was when I came in five minutes into the meeting and what I kept on getting was that there were additional amendments that were introduced by the department.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">If that is the case, I want to know why we as commissioners were never informed of any of those amendments?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I think that it has been the practice or the understanding that any Supervisor driven legislation or resolutions that relates to Planning will come back to us and we will have the ability to weigh in on it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">It sounds to me like we didn't weigh in, the department did, and we will get information that this is what's going on.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I think we are supposed to weigh in and create an impacting policy and have our discussions as well.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">It makes me feel uncomfortable that amendments were offered and we had no input on any of the amendments whether we approved or disapproved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Nothing.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">Having undertaken the historic resource evaluation of that project, we realized there were a number of other similar evaluations of historic resources that were undertaken in the south of Market area immediately in the vicinity of 10<sup>th</sup> and Folsom and eighth and Harrison and other areas.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I think to their credit these were done separately by different companies for different purposes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> But I think the interesting thing was that the conclusions that were reached under each of the separate surveys indicated there was a potential for perhaps a historic district in the area.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">And after many years, the department has issued a request for proposals to undertake work to gather the information that is collected and add a survey component to that so that the department can have a more comprehensive idea of what exists in the south of market area.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I think in support of Commissioner Lee and Commissioner Olague we need to find a way to create more time to properly be informed and participate in these reviews because in the end we are jointly responsible for the outcome.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I don't think we got it late or rushed to let this boil up in the manner it did last night.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">None-the-less, I think there are some things we need to talk about policy-wise as far as how we communicate with staff and how staff communicates with the Commission on issues of that nature.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I would like to calendar for next week a closed session to discuss our Director's search.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-family: 'Times New Roman'">I don't know how to respond to it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">About three years ago this commission heard a conditional use for a hotel on Lombard Street.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">All hotels in San Francisco have been conditional uses for the past 10 years.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The neighbors who backed onto this project were very concerned about it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Typically when you have a neighborhood commercial district and residential behind, there are conflicts over what happens with the design.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">My recollection is that the commission cut back the project in the rear to respond to the neighborhood's concerns.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The project was appealed to the Board of Supervisors under their conditional use power.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In September 2003, the Board acted on this item at about 2 a.m. in the morning &ndash; I remember that hearing went to 6 in the morning.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The Board cut that building back further by about 20 feet from the rear property line.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">And the rear property line is the important issue because the site is not rectangular.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The site is like a rectangle with two corners taken out of it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There is a rear property line and then further forward, there are two other property lines that are parallel to the rear property line.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Is this making any sense at all?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We have a rectangle with two squares taken out.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What the issue comes down to now is when the Board said set it back 20 feet from the rear property line, which rear property line?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Only the very rear or the two parallel to the rear property lines?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Staff reviewed the building permit as it came through.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Staff's interpretation was that the Planning Commission and therefore the Board and their analysis seemed to only be talking about the rear most rear property line.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It comes to my attention.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Lucky me, I get to interpret what the Board of Supervisors did.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I have the transcripts and tape.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I may talk to the Supervisors.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I will keep them informed on what I intend to do.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I had discussions with the City Attorney.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I have not made any determination.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">This is a non-binding resolution that is not required to come to you.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">But as you will see, it pertains to very important Planning policies and decisions so the Board exceeded to our request that it be sent to your for your review and deliberation.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Staff had very little time to respond to this.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In our preliminary assessment we came up with two very grave concerns.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">One was the ability of the Department to really in a feasible and practical way perform on what was being asked of the Department.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The second was if we included many of the things that were being asked of us, there would be delays in the schedule that everyone wanted to maintain.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Being faced with these two objectives that did not accommodate each other from deadlines and more work, we had to represent the technical difficulties in being able to perform.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The simple message was easy to give that it would cause delays and it would require us to do things that are possibly not feasible, at least not at first blush, or not practical to implement through land use area plans and General Plan implementation.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In trying to explain the difficulties, they get to be technical.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Many of the technical details discussed yesterday have been accommodated in the revised ordinance that the Board sent you.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There still remain very difficult issues we believe need your deliberation.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As regards to the delay, wherever we are today the Eastern Neighborhoods is on a course that with proper diligence and dispatch we will be able to deliver on schedule &ndash; which now is around October of 2007.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> By then we would have completed all staff work for its consideration for adoption by you and the Board.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">That would require us to publish the draft EIR in April of 2007 and give us six months of hearing it, complete the workshops and adopt the plans.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We represented to the Board there are certain things in the Department's control as far as the schedule is concerned.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When it gets to hearings and response to public comment that is not something we can prejudge.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> And we have to react to the comments and the number of hearings that will be required to resolve the issues.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What we represented was if we got distracted from the course that we had set ourselves and had to stop and rethink the scope of the EIR, and the scope of the plan implementation elements that would then require an undetermined amount of time and resources.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We've fully deployed our resources and the time available.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If there were more work and more scoping and redoing of EIRs to be done, it would take more time.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">A simple example of the re-scoping would be that the Board has asked us to concentrate on the Eastern Neighborhoods area as it is defined in this resolution, which is different from what we scoped out in the EIR and plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's all South of Market and in our plans we don't include West SOMA.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">That is an example of the technical work that needs to be re-scoped to entertain some of the Board's decisions.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Beyond that, the Land Use Committee resolution would hold all of us to find it consistent with a specific set of General Plan objectives.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Not on balance, but individually applied to the fullest extent and make sure that the plans are consistent with each and every one of those General Plan objectives.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As you know, the General Plan is internally consistent but there are competing objectives.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The way the General Plan objectives apply to particular circumstances is you do an on balance determination of the priorities that prevail given the circumstance.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Take the Eastern Neighborhoods Area Plans.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What exactly would you like to actually happen in that area?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Therefore, you would look at the objectives of the plans and find it consistent with the General Plan.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If you follow along with me you will see that we are required to find the objectives and policies cited in the  Where As's as the set of policies with which the entire plan needs to be consistent.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Unless we get an agreement that it is on balance, that we find it consistent, we believe it will almost be impossible to do so.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There will be competing objectives, as you will see.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The first that come up is the Housing Elements objective of establishing and recognizing the need for housing and the kinds of housing that you need.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">For background commissioners, the Housing Element establishes a need for San Francisco in terms of total housing units that need to be produced in a certain time period.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">That translated to 20,400 units in a time frame that ends in the year 2009 of which 13,500 need to be below market, which is 64%.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It's a noble objective and persuades the city to do its best to perform to meet that need.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It's not the city's practice nor does it have the ability to come close to that level of below market production.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We have on average been able to maintain about 25% of the total housing production as below market.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Even in areas where we have more public control like in redevelopment areas we have been able to achieve 30 to 35% at the most.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Faced with that reality, if you look at what the Board is really requesting, the plans to perform against, we have produced 3,500 units for affordable, below market units.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> That's 25%</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If in whatever circumstances we are able to reach our target of 2,400 units in this time frame &ndash; and we expect to do that &ndash; in order to meet fully this performance standard, we would now have to produce 110% of what is left at affordable levels.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Any housing unit that is produced from now on, to meet this objective, would not only have to be a hundred percent affordable, but also go beyond and produce more than the targets to reach the 64%.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">And if you read through the Board's resolution, you will find that we are being asked to do this all in the Eastern Neighborhood's area.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">And we are being asked to identify and preserve it.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">But I think it got changed to identify and preserve sites that would allow the implementation or production of these kinds of housing that I just described.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">To us it seemed that the Planning Department with its purview and jurisdiction was in no way able to perform to these standards.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We felt it would be remiss if we didn't point out the difficulties and we did.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">As far as these goals and objectives are concerned, unless we add a qualification of that, it's a realm of infeasibility.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We can't attain these standards.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There will be a presentation and a case report given to you next week for a presentation on the 26<sup>th</sup>.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">There are other requirements that go along with it that have to be equally applied.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">When you consider that all the housing that need to be produced in Eastern Neighborhood's area and pile on top of that the requirements for protecting PDR needs in the same area; existing and new PDR needs, providing open space and transportation systems adequate for that amount of growth within this area; if you put all that together and take out the unbalanced clause, it is impossible to produce plans that would meaningfully be able to achieve these goals.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We pointed that out.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We also suggested that these things are not scoped out in the existing EIR as it is being pursued today.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If we were to decide that this needs to be included we will have to re-scope the EIR to figure out what the implications this would be.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Why is terminology important?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Nomenclature is a system for naming things.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Architectural names use icons.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">By considering this we are forced to think about the concepts they embody that will help us understand the buildings we review and what makes them good buildings.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I will talk about terms in pairs.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">I want to set them up in pairs because we can consider how they are similar and the differences among the members of the pairs.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">We will talk about siteing and massing, height and bulk, shape and form, structure and materials; rhythm and imagination; symmetry and balance, complexity and coherence.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Siteing</span></i></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">is the location of the structure on the lot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is the footprint of the building; how the building hits the ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is where the structure is on the site and where is the open space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It relates to setback, locations and uses of open space, entries and parking, traffic, the sun and shade.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Massing</span></i></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">is a three-dimensional distribution volume on the site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">It s when you stack a roof and floor plates over the building footprint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It has relationship to height and bulk.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Height and Bulk</span></i></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They have common meanings in English.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> In planning they are dimensional elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> When we talk about <b><i>height</i></b> in technical planning code, we are talking about vertical dimensions of the building.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> On the other hand, <b><i>bulk</i></b> is a look at horizontal dimensions that include the longest building wall in the plan; the longest diagonal dimensions and the floor plate area.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The bulk is how wide it is in height and the effect it has on the street wall.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In planning, when we talk about <b><i>scale</i></b> what we are looking at is a relationship of the building to its environment to the street; to the adjacent buildings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> We perceive the scale through our knowledge of the human body&ndash;how big we are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is about the relationship of the building site to the external world.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Proportion</span></i></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">is the relationship of the building's elements to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's the width of the building to its height.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's height or width of the building and individual elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It is about internal relationships of the building elements and itself.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Complexity.</span></i></b><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> A simple faÃ§ade can be elegant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Sometimes it is appropriate to have a subdued and un-complex response.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Other times complexity adds a richness and appropriateness in certain settings.</span></li>

<li><b><i><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Coherence</span></i></b> <span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">refers to a harmonious relationship among the various elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It can let the building read through the faÃ§ade in a mixed-use building where there are storefronts and people living above.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> <b><i>Coherence</i></b> can be achieved by having a strength and purpose to the design and avoiding the feeling of arbitrary decisions.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Lastly, <b><i>Composition</i></b> is the arrangement of the elements.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It's how things are organized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">At all times when we are measuring how tall buildings are, how big they look and how big a bulk to you, you are looking at whether or not it's on a hill, which could make a four-story building look like a seven-story building.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: black; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I would say that I revised the language of Mr. Nikita's presentation in the case of the corner building he showed early on where the massing is on a corner and you see two facades.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> It was gracious of him to imply that a variance be considered so it would complete the block face.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">State law now requires the City to retrofit and rebuild the acute medical system to ensure hospital operations after a seismic event.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The Mayor directs the Health Department to have a master plan for sub-acute medical facilities.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">This is separate from universal health clinic care.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">During the fiscal times, I know DCP staff advocated the developed of an institutional plan for acute medical in the City suggesting that the hospitals fund it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This was not done.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">From what I learned form the new positions, no one is assigned the task.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Why are we building?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> The State wants hospitals without a master plan.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Individual institutional master plans don't make sense.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Hospitals as a business have marketing objectives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is one role they play in our seismic zone.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">CPMC's architects say they are [closing] their place on Van Ness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> They said they want to be in competition with the hospitals in the city.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">There is a question of the public interest and geographic balance.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Absent such a plan, it may be that DCP and the city is placing at risk hospital EIRs, including CPMC, which is something before us in the future.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Medical institutions more than educational institutions drove the Institutional Master Plan Ordinance, which you have heard briefly once.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It was designed to be a full disclosure ordinance, so that before there was CEQA, you could get your project out there a week before it was approved.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">When they came through at the same time in the early 70's there was a revolt because they were surrounding the same area from Pacific Heights to the Inner Sunset.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">It provided protection for the neighborhoods and as Ms. Hestor said, it provided a breathing space so people didn't jam through the Supervisors and the Commission.</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">In those days we were raising serious issues like, why in a City that has the largest number of hospital beds per capita, has the largest hospital costs per capita?</span></li>

<li><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">We had a tremendous surplus of facilities in the City.</span></li>
