      <p>- He lives on Huron Street.</p>

      <p>- If they were officially under oath, the project representatives would be committing perjury.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">BOS -</font></p>

      <p>In addition to the budget proceedings at the Board, the following occurred:</p>

      <p><i>Board of Supervisors Hearing of June 24, 2003:</i></p>

      <p><font class="heading2">O'Shaughnessy Dam Negative Declaration Appeal:</font></p>

      <p>The Board unanimously upheld the Commission's certification of the Negative Declaration appeal, but only after they adopted a resolution sponsored by Supervisor Ammiano and agreed to by the PUC to specify that the project correspond to that which was analyzed by the Negative Declaration and no more. This effectively restricts the PUC from discharging any additional water from the dam beyond what was analyzed in our Negative Declaration.</p>

      <p><i><u>Other appeals were continued until July 22:</u></i></p>

      <p>1)<font class="heading2"> 40-50 Lansing Street:</font> CU appeal of the 82-unit residential project at 40-50 Lansing St. The appeal has been filed by 5 members of the Board of Supervisors. </p>

      <p>2)<font class="heading2"> 3725 Buchanan Street:</font> CU appeal of your May 1 decision to authorize a total of 8 Verizon Wireless antennas on 3725 Buchanan that was filed by 20% of surrounding property owners. </p>

      <p><i><u>New Appeals filed</u>:</i></p>

      <p><font class="heading2">19<sup>th</sup> Street PG&amp;E Transformer:</font> CU appeal by the appellant, Mr. Todd Curtis, on behalf of the neighborhood group, the Lexington, San Carlos Neighborhood Coalition. There had been a question as to whether the 20% signatures were valid and sufficient, but the discrepancies have now been clarified and the matter has qualified for an appeal hearing. This has also been scheduled for July 22, 2003.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">270-284 Valencia Street:  </font>This is a project to demolish a one-story former car repair shop structure and construct a four-story, 28 units residential building over 3,533 sf of ground-floor retail and 31 off street parking spaces in the basement.  It was subject to a CU for a change of use per Mission District Interim Controls.  The CU was approved unanimously by this Commission on May 16, 2003, and it had generated no substantial opposition. The appeal has been filed by a next door neighbor of the project and qualified for an appeal with the signature of 5 members of the Board. (Daly, Gonzalez, Maxwell, Ammiano, Dufty), it is scheduled for July 15, 2003 with an addition to the appeal on the secondary unit environmental exemption.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">BOA - </font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Lingba Lounge - 18<sup>th</sup> Street</i></p>

      <p>- When this came before the Commission, your decision was to take Discretionary Review and amend the hours of operation.  You approved:  Sunday through Thursday, to 12:00 a.m., and Friday and Saturday, to 1:00 a.m.  This came before the BOA in order to get the hours of operation lengthened.  The BOA overturned the Commission's decision and decided on the following hours of operation:  Sunday through Wednesday to 10:30 p.m., and  Thursday to Saturday to 1:00 a.m.</p>

      <p>- The proponents of the project, with the consent of the Planning Department, determined that the project should be 1-1/2 feet less.</p>

      <p>- He has been working on this project for almost a year.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jenne Milligan - Telegraph Hill Dwellers Association</font></p>

      <p>- This project is too bulky, dense, and is not particularly useful for small businesses.</p>

      <p>- There is a need to have a building that will be viewed by thousands of visitors.</p>

      <p>- This is an eyesore because of the bulk and the height.</p>

      <p>- This project is too large for the space.</p>

      <p>-  It is important to get the architects together and come to a solution.</p>

      <p>- The top level of the structure should be set back and there would be two penthouses.</p>

      <p>- Comments usually discredit the reputation of the sponsors.</p>

      <p>- This is a very complicated project.</p>

      <p>- It is important to not look at the number of stories, but to look at the height.</p>

The Zoning Administrator will consider a request for a variance from requirements for usable open space.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and disapprove the Permit Application.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER (S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Cristine Patterson - Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- They purchased their home in 1996.  Originally, the building was built with three units.</p>

      <p>- There are two units on the lower floor and two units on the middle floor and one unit on the top.</p>

      <p>- The Rent Board gave the approval in 1996 to merge the top two units into one and this has been their home ever since.</p>

      <p>- The property has been in disrepair.</p>

      <p>- There has been a lot of tenant turnover in the units, because the units offer livability for only one or two people.  There have been many young married couples renting the units, but whey they had children they had to move because the units are so small.</p>

      <p>- If they were able to merge the units and bring it back to a full floor unit that would accommodate a family or roommates, it would be more convenient for the tenants.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Michael Parrett</font></p>

      <p>- He realizes that the Commission has a policy to review all merger cases, but sometimes there are exceptions and this is one of them.</p>

      <p>- The merger would not cause any displacement.</p>

      <p>  </p>

      <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the merger of the first floor units.  They delayed the merger of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor units until the tenants voluntarily move out.</p>

The property is within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-Family) Zoning District and a 50-X Height and Bulk District.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER (S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jennifer Fong - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

      <p>- Since she filed the Discretionary Review, the project sponsor has revised his plans, but there are still issues that need to be dealt with.</p>

      <p>- There is a street tree that will be affected with this construction.</p>

      <p>- The tree is the major green space on the street.</p>

      <p>- She questioned the health of the new replacement tree.</p>

      <p>- She wants to contest the Planning Department's review of the parking situation caused by the garage.</p>

      <p>- She is concerned that there will be structural damage to her property when the proposed property is raised.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+)  Lisa Nakajara</font></p>

      <p>- She has three areas of concerns: 1) safety and an increase in traffic congestion; 2) negative impact on street noise and beautification of the area; 3) direct impact on her building.</p>

      <p>- There are a very large number of cars traveling at high speeds in the area.</p>

      <p>- She would love to see the buildings cleaned up, but she is concerned about the tree that will be lost.</p>

      <p>- She is at home during the day.  She is concerned that she will not be able to continue living there because there might be construction damage, and because there is a shared wall with the proposed project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ana Sears</font></p>

      <p>- She and her husband have lived on Guerrero Street for the last 20 years.</p>

      <p>- They have seen many serious accidents.</p>

      <p>-  The garage in their building has been impossible to use.  In order to maneuver a vehicle into the garage entrance, which is 6 feet from the corner of Cesar Chavez and only 12 feet wide, the vehicle also has to be perpendicular to the flow of traffic.</p>

      <p>- During commute hours, there are is even a larger number of cars coming around the corner, almost blindly.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Jon</font></p>

      <p>- He has lived on Guerrero Street since 1968.</p>

      <p>- He has worked with the Police Department for 23 years.</p>

      <p>- If this project is built, there will be three parking spots taken away and this will affect the neighbors.</p>

      <p>- The construction will cause an indentation on the sidewalk.</p>

      <p>- There is a senior day program nearby and there are a lot of seniors that come participate.  The proposed construction could have a negative effect on them.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Michelle Gettos</font></p>

      <p>- She has lived on Guerrero Street for many years.</p>

      <p>-  She contests the Planning Department's review on parking.</p>

      <p>- She has a concern of the increased traffic on the street.</p>

      <p>- She hopes that the Commission will disapprove the project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gary Nathan</font></p>

      <p>- He is concerned that the character of the neighborhood will not be maintained with the proposed project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jorge Morashima</font></p>

      <p>- There is traffic safety issue with this project.</p>

      <p>- He feels that these issues have extraordinary and exceptional circumstances.</p>

      <p>- The proposed project is a mirror image of the adjacent house, so it will definitely not look good for one to be higher than the other.</p>

      <p>- The loss to the street is one of the beautiful characteristics of the street.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Simon Quan - Project Architect</font>.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor was not able to come to the hearing.</p>

      <p>- He explained the architectural aspects of the project.</p>

      <p>- It is very difficult to lift the building and provide parking, but it will add quality to the building.</p>

      <p>- From a construction point of view the building will be reinforced and made safer.</p>

      <p>- To accommodate this construction there will be professional construction and structural companies to do the work.</p>

      <p>- The reason to move the tree is to be able to maneuver cars into the garage.</p>

      <p>- The proposed project would cover a large amount of the easement area.</p>

      <p>- The easement does not permit the owner to construct any improvements.</p>

      <p>- He is confused about the City's policy since the permit application itself requires disclosing this information.</p>

      <p>- The better policy is to have the DR granted and maintain the status quo.</p>

      <p>- There would not be a lot of space used from the easement.</p>

      <p>- When the chair is not in use, the chair would be on top and tucked away.</p>

      <p>- The Discretionary Review requestors are concerned that there would be large alterations on the easement.</p>
