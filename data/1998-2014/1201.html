  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <p><i>PRESENTERS:</i></p>
    <p><b>Paul Zeger - Pacific Marketing Associates</b></p>
    <p>- He has been in this business since 1986. </p>
    <p>- Since then, he has participated in 150 different residential 
      developments--about 100 of those in and around the San Francisco area.</p>
    <p>- One of the unique characteristics of his company is 
      that because they are not developers, they are not representing one particular 
      project but a whole range of projects that are taking place around San Francisco. 
      </p>
    <p>- They first communicate with the buyer and their particular 
      preferences of what they would like to buy, where they would like to live, 
      how they would like it.</p>
    <p>- Then they communicate with the bankers who define 
      what, in fact, one can afford to buy as far as product.</p>
    <p>- The third person they communicate with is the builder--what 
      one can afford to build and how can they deliver the product. </p>
    <p>- The last component is the City and the Commission 
      on where these products/homes can be built, etc.</p>
    <p>- San Francisco is a unique city because it is geographically 
      defined and the ability for expansion is very limited. </p>
    <p>- As a company they have specialized in urban infill 
      and have participated in much of the new high-rise condominium development 
      as well as projects that are going on in other locations. </p>
    <p><b>John Stewart - John Stewart Company</b></p>
    <p>- His company has been around for 27 years. </p>
    <p>- They have 1,100 people and five offices.</p>
    <p>- They manage an inventory of about 24,000 units in 
      the State of California. </p>
    <p>- In the Bay Area, they manage about 12,000 units and 
      in San Francisco they have about 6,000.</p>
    <p>- Their clients consists of seniors, commercial, condominiums, 
      upper end cooperatives and low and moderate units, tax credits, etc.</p>
    <p>- In San Francisco they have 45 complexes, 6,600 units. 
      Of the 45 complexes, 29 are affordable.</p>
    <p>- They work with two &quot;care not cash&quot; properties 
      and have seven in total that are under the Department of Public Health, 
      and three under the Department of Human Services.</p>
    <p><b>Eric Harris - Signature Properties</b></p>
    <p>- They are a privately held company located in Pleasanton. 
      </p>
    <p>- They have been in business since 1983. Over the last 
      22 years they have built about 5,000 dwelling units. </p>
    <p>- Their primary market is in the Bay Area, but they 
      have recently expanded into the Sacramento area. </p>
    <p>- One of the keystone principles of his company is to 
      build units or housing that are going to be ultimately an integral part 
      of the community. </p>
    <p>- Signature Properties was the first residential project 
      in Mission Bay to come out of the ground.</p>
    <p>- What Signature did was a very thorough market analysis 
      to determine what the needs were--what the desires of future homeowners 
      would be like if they relocated in the areas of South of Market and Mission 
      Bay. </p>
    <p>- After doing the market analysis they discovered that 
      there is an overwhelming demand for two-bedroom or two-bedroom plus units. 
      In their first project, they have approximately 90% two-bedroom or two-bedroom 
      plus units and about 10% one bedroom or one bedroom plus units. </p>
    <p>- The units ranged from small one-bedroom units of about 
      750 square feet, all the way up to their standard flats of about 1,400 square 
      feet. </p>
    <p>- From their market analysis they found there was a 
      tremendous demand for family housing. A substantial portion of the projects 
      they are proposing for the near future will have a significant number of 
      three and four bedroom units. They feel that this is indicative of that 
      area. </p>
    <p><i>NOTE: Amit Ghosh read into the record a report from 
      Mr. Bill Whitty who was not able to attend. His company, Related Properties, 
      owns the high-rise on Third and Mission Streets. The report gave percentages 
      of how many units are below market and how many are market rate.</i></p>
    <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>
    <p><b>Steven Chester - Local Homeless Coor. Board</b></p>
    <p>- He has been living in San Francisco since 1997</p>
    <p>- San Francisco has always had an intense controversy 
      on housing issues. </p>
    <p>- He is concerned that there is not enough housing for 
      low-income people.</p>
    <p>- This is his adopted home and he wants to stay in San 
      Francisco for the rest of his life.</p>
    <p>- It is important to concentrate on the 10-year plan.</p>
    <p><b>Robert Pender - Park Merced Residents Association</b></p>
    <p>- There is a Mission Valley developer that wants to 
      build about 150 apartments on Brotherhood Way. He is supporting this developer.</p>
    <p><b>Eric Quesada - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition</b></p>
    <p>- The development that is taking place in San Francisco 
      is not filling the needs of the residents.</p>
    <p>- There should be more creative ways to fund housing 
      for people who need it.</p>
    <p>- It's the Commission's responsibility to say no to 
      projects if they do not meet the needs of the people.</p>
    <p><b>Chris Durazo - SOMECAN</b></p>
    <p>- This information should be filtered through MOH (Mayor's 
      Office of Housing).</p>
    <p>- She was interested in all the statistics presented, 
      but all the areas that were spoken about are so isolated.</p>
    <p>- She hopes that this cross section does not continue.</p>
    <p>- There are a lot of statistics given for demographics, 
      but not all the information was presented.</p>
    <p><b>Jose Morales - SFTU, MAC</b></p>
    <p>- The environmental report must include neighbors needs, 
      create better communities, analyze what matters most in the communities-- 
      pedestrian safety, local businesses, etc.</p>
    <p>- He thanked the Commission for protecting his affordable 
      housing unit.</p>
    <p>- He has been working with MAC in helping to preserve 
      affordable housing.</p>
    <p>- More affordable housing is needed for seniors. Ellis 
      Acts should be stopped.</p>
    <p><b>Lou Blazej</b></p>
    <p>- He thanked interim Director and Dr. Amit Ghosh for 
      putting this special meeting together.</p>
    <p>- He is working with a lot of private developers who 
      want to address affordability and diversity.</p>
    <p>- The code should be amended to allow 12 or 15 percent 
      on a square footage basis in order to provide more affordable housing.</p>
    <p>- The goal is to have more affordable housing.</p>
    <p><b>Dick Millet - Potrero Boosters</b></p>
    <p>- There is no risk when it comes to housing because 
      everything gets sold.</p>
    <p>- The City should stick to one to one parking.</p>
    <p>- There is a lot of information that the speakers did 
      not mention like crime, public open space, etc.</p>
    <p>- Public open space is going to be needed.</p>
    <p><b>Jeremy Nelson - Transportation for a Livable City</b></p>
    <p>- It is great that this hearing was held.</p>
    <p>- He hopes that this is the first word and not the last 
      word.</p>
    <p>- A monthly session on the future of downtown would 
      be ideal.</p>
    <p>- Staff, MTA, etc. should be the first to be the presenters.</p>
    <p>- He hopes the Commission will not use the information 
      from the presenters as policy.</p>
    <p>- Price and affordability are very important with regard 
      to parking decisions.</p>
    <p><b>Sue Hestor</b></p>
    <p>- There was not enough discussion on what are the needs 
      of the Housing Element.</p>
    <p>- How much of the ABAG goals are given?</p>
    <p>- The Planning Department has stopped [issuing] housing 
      data.</p>
    <p>- She submitted a chart that gives housing data, which 
      she compiled herself from Department information.</p>
    <p>- It is important to find the needs of people and base 
      the housing information on them.</p>
    <p>- There are computers programs that help to find the 
      data. Computers should be integrated through the respective Departments 
      to compile this data.</p>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>B. PUBLIC COMMENT</b></p>

  <ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. </p>

  <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>

  <p>(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or</p>

  <p>(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or </p>

  <p>(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))</p>

  <p><b>Chris Durazo</b></p>

  <p><i>Re:  Workshops </i></p>

  <p>- The workshops should not be used to influence the analysis of certain projects.</p>

  <p>- If the Commission is going to use workshops, she hopes that the information includes financing.</p>

  <p>- If Trinity Plaza is going to be used as an example then the interested parties should be included as well.</p>

  <p><b>Jose Morales</b></p>

  <p>- There should be some public benefit incentive in zoning when something is being built.</p>

  <p>- Does the City want to preserve affordable housing or is it going to be destroyed?</p>
