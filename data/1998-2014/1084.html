The Commission or Director of Planning or the Zoning Administrator may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.<br><br>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:  Emergency Ordinance Legislation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Director explained how the emergency ordinance legislation allows Discretionary Review cases to be heard by the Director of Planning and that Conditional Uses are brought forward by request of the applicant.  The applicant, therefore, submits a letter addressed to the Director, waiving their rights to be heard by the Planning Commission.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:  No Hearing of October 31, 2002 and November 7, 2002<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;October 31, 2002 is a fifth Thursday and pursuant to Planning Commission Rules and Regulations that hearing is canceled.  To schedule a Special Hearing on this date the Department would need to meet the required time constraints for legal notices and postings.  Unfortunately we cannot do so.  Therefore, the meeting for October 31, 2002 remains canceled.  Also, unless a full Planning Commission is assembled, the hearing scheduled for November 7, 2002 is also canceled.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:  Planning Commission Nominations<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Supervisors did not confirm all of the nominations from the Mayor for the Planning Commission.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:  Extending Emergency Legislation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rules Committee will be holding a hearing to extend this emergency legislation.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of Adoption &ndash; draft minute of Planning Director and Zoning Administrator's Meeting of September 26, 2002.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTION:  Director approved the minutes as drafted.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMISSION MATTERS<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Election of Officers<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not applicable for this hearing.<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission Comments<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not applicable for this hearing.<br><br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission or Director and Zoning Administrator on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, they must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission or Director and Zoning Administrator for up to three minutes.<br><br>Re:  965-985 Geneva Street and 852 Paris Street (AKA Apollo Theatre)<br>(+) Joseph Breall<br>- The site for this project has been vacant for many years.<br>- He hopes that this project is not tainted by negativity from the pervious Commission.  This is a very fair and good project.<br>- The anchor tenant does not agree with the Department's proposal.<br>(+) Lawrence Lee<br>- They are prepared to retain one small storefront.<br>- The anchor tenant will improve the area by providing jobs and aesthetically improving the neighborhood.<br>- One of the reasons that many small stores have gone out of business is because the vacant location is an eyesore.  Bringing an anchor tenant will allow for a livelier neighborhood.<br>(+) Michael Yamauchi<br>- The neighborhood has used a lot of scare tactics to keep away the anchor tenant.<br>- Many small pharmacies have survived with a Walgreen's near by.<br>(+) Calvin Yee<br>- Please approve the project as proposed because if the project is revised, the anchor tenant will withdraw it's application.<br>(+) Catherine Pacheco<br>- She has lived in this area her entire life.<br>- She works in the neighborhood and is a member of the Outer Mission Neighborhood Association.<br>- There are a lot of storefront vacancies.<br>- This project is trying to revitalize this area.<br>(+) Stephen Currier<br>- The Outer Mission Neighborhood Association has met and voted that it still supports this project.<br>- He did a neighborhood walk with Supervisor Hall and they noticed that there were two other stores that have closed since the Commission last met.<br>(+) Robert Grecco<br>- He was born and raised in this area.<br>- All around the block there is metered parking with a two-hour maximum.  Parking will not be an issue.<br>- The loading dock will not be on the Geneva side so that won't be a problem either.<br>(+) Sheila Pacheco<br>- She is in favor of the project.<br>- She has seen the Apollo Theater come up and come down.  She used to take her daughter there when there was something to see do.<br>- Walgreen's will bring other services to this neighborhood.<br>(+) Dennis Chu<br>- He submitted new evidence that pharmacies have coexisted with larger chain pharmacies.<br>(+) Karen Hemer<br>- This building really needs to be developed.<br>- There are many businesses duplicated in the area.<br>- There are also a lot of empty storefronts.<br>- Geneva needs one large business for its revitalization.<br>(-) Mrs. Blanch Simons<br>- There are no empty storefronts on Geneva.<br>- Every store is taken.<br>- Those two storefronts are needed.<br>(-) Ed Nazrah<br>- This project has not been able to move forward in a fair way because of the controversy of the previous Commission.<br>- There are issues here about Proposition M as well.<br>(-) George Nazrah<br>- His concern is about the miscommunication about the empty storefronts.<br>- There are two Walgreen's within a close proximity.<br>- There is word on the street that the project is a done deal.<br>- Walgreen's is not even really that interested in this site.  The project sponsors are the ones who would like to have a fancy anchor store for their property.<br>(-) Dexter Massoletti<br>- There is a sad political situation here.<br>- He hopes that this kind of procedural situation does not continue.  There are many people in high positions with too much power.<br>(-) Dorothy Ann Jones<br>- She agrees that the neighborhood does not need a Walgreen's.<br>- There will be a problem with parking.<br>(-) Marion G. Nasrah<br>- She has lived in the area for the last 37 years.<br>- There are a lot of Walgreen's in the area.  There are enough stores already.<br>- There is no need for a Walgreen's here.<br>(-) Jiwanah Nazrah<br>- This project involves an unneeded Walgreen's that would cause many traffic problems.<br>- There are many Walgreen's close to this area.<br>(-) Dan Pierini<br>- The community does not support this project.<br>- He has done a lot of research.<br>(+) Tiffany Nguyen<br>- All the accusations and controversies are not appropriate for this hearing.<br>- The issue here is if a Walgreen's is appropriate for this neighborhood.<br>- With this anchor tenant other smaller businesses will benefit.<br>- There are many businesses that support this project.<br><br>E.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL ACTION &ndash; UNLESS OTHERWISE NOTED, THE PUBLIC HEARING FOR THIS CATEGORY IS CLOSED.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2002.0452D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T.

Also, submit a complete formal and professional profile that shows the entire condition including the DR requestor's property.

This matter was continued to June 27, 2002, to allow the absent commissioners to participate in the final action.<br>NOTE: On June 27, 2002, the Commission entertained the motion to approve with conditions to allow 2 storefronts instead of the proposed 3.  Motion failed to carry by a vote +3 &ndash;2.  Commissioner Chinchilla was excused.  Commissioner Fay was absent.   At the call of the Chair the matter was continued to August 1, 2002.<br>NOTE: On September 12, 2002, this matter was continued indefinitely. It has since been re-noticed and placed on the October 10, 2002 calendar<br>(Continued from Regular Meeting of September 12, 2002)<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director recommends Approval with the following conditions:<br>1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding Conditional Use, allow for the creation of residential housing without the required parking.  These findings can be made under Section 161(j).  The Director recommends to approve that portion of the Conditional Use request.<br>2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding the installation of a large retail tenant on the ground floor.  The allowable use is 5,900 sf.  The project sponsor indicated that their proposal before the Department is to allow Walgreen's to consume the entire space except for the space which is currently occupied by the shoe cobbler.  A case has not been made for this type of proposal.  He does not believe that the findings are there specifically with regards to the priority policies under Section 101.1.  There has been a case made, those spaces are valuable and are capable of being occupied by small retail businesses potentially owned by people who live in the immediate neighborhood or at least the immediate neighborhood could provide employment to those small businesses.  The findings from Section 121 have not been made with regard to the need for that space.  The Director recommends that the project sponsor's submittal be denied.  But, the Director would recommend to the appealing body, if this is necessary, would allow a project that would include the space that staff is proposing except that the Director would be willing to consider after an appropriate period of time (a one year period) after the occupancy established by Walgreen's that store No. 3 mentioned in the applicant's attorney's letter dated October 4, 2002, could ultimately be absorbed into the Walgreen's space.  But the design of the space would be controlled by the Planning Department in order to have an interactive frontage and not just the original design which Walgreen's proposed.  Store No. 2 and Store No. 1 could continue to exist.<br>Final Action:  Director recommends to accept staff's recommendation and approve the conditional use related to Section 161(j) and that the motion expresses that the project sponsor's proposal to eliminate all of the existing store fronts except Store No. 1 to be occupied by a large retail tenant be denied because the Department is not able to make the findings under Section 1.1 and 121 of the Planning Code but under Conditions of Approval, the Director would grant an amended project and the findings should be made to reflect that.  Stores No. 1, 2 and 3 must be created along with Walgreen's.  After a 1 year period that Walgreen's has occupied that space if the project sponsor has not been able to find a sufficient tenant for that space, the space could ultimately become usable by Walgreen's with the design be considered by the Planning Department.  The Conditional Use authorization for lot size over 10,000 sf is approved as well.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001.1126CV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.
