        <ul>
          <p>1. 2003.1110T (C. NIKITAS:(415) 558-6306)</p>
          <p><u>REQUIRED SECOND MEANS OF EGRESS</u> - Ordinance 
            Amending the San Francisco Planning Code to Allow a Required Second 
            Means of Egress <font class="heading2">Adoption of an ordinance amending the San Francisco 
            Planning Code</font> by adding a new section 136(c)(4)(A)(i-v) to allow 
            certain stairways that are a required second means of egress under 
            the Building Code, as permitted obstructions in the rear yard. The 
            California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second 
            means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides 
            an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code. This ordinance 
            also includes changes to Section 311 and 312 to require neighbor notification 
            for the addition of these stairways.</p>
          <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Recommend approval 
            of the ordinance to the Board of Supervisors.</p>

          <p>9.<u> ALTERNATING CASE TYPES</u> - <font class="heading2">On February 
            19, 2004</font>, the Commission adopted the recommendation of Acting 
            Director, Larry Badiner to mix each calendar by alternating case types. 
            (i.e. Discretionary Review type cases would be first one week on the 
            calendar and Conditional Uses and other type cases would be first 
            the next week). The Commission also instructed that this be brought 
            back to them for review in three months. </p>

              </ul>
              <p>- proposal is to raise the cottage; excavate 
                to provide a living area; put open space on top of living areas; 
                then construct a cottage.</p>
              <p>- This project had an earlier Certificate 
                of Appropriateness, it was heard by the Landmarks Board who concurred 
                that the existing building has an entrance on the Union Street 
                steps. They determined that it was important to maintain those 
                steps.</p>
              <p>- The project sponsor is concerned that a 
                real stairway to a false entry does not make sense.</p>
              <ul>
                <p>- It would be useful to hear from project

            the old building as well as the new one.</p>
          <p>- The owners feel that they would really like 
            to relocate the front door to the courtyard.</p>
          <p>- They did have a complete permit and Certificate 
            of Appropriateness.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">Mr. Freebairn-Smith</font></p>
          <p>- He just wants to assure the Commission that 
            this project, even though it is very old, that nothing casual is happening 
            here.</p>
          <p>- The courtyard entry is the most logical way 
            to enter the building.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">Jeremy Paul</font></p>
          <p>- He did extensive research on this property a 
            few years ago.</p>
          <p>- After putting in lots of research, the owner 
            decided that he was not interested in the challenge of the task so 
            he decided to sell the property.</p>
          <p>- He is glad that the new owner is taking really 
            good care of the property.</p>
          <p>ACTION: Director Badiner has taken the matter 
            under advisement and will report back to the Commission at a future 
            hearing.</p>

            was some discussion as to whether to continue this item or not. Ultimately

          <p>- The discussion with the Assessor has taken place 
            over the last year with the project sponsor.</p>

            again because both sides have new attorneys.</p>
          <p><i>Re: 899 North Pont</i></p>

            which will be finished this weekend. This project is not good for 
            the neighborhood.</p>

            19th and 20th Streets; Lot 001A in Assessor's Block 4065 - <font class="heading2">Request 
            for Discretionary Review</font> of Building Permit Application No. 2003.08.11.1725 
            proposing to construct a one-story vertical addition to the existing 
            one-story over garage building in an RH-2 (Residential, House, Two-Family) 
            District with a 40-X Height and Bulk Designation.</p>
          <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Do not take Discretionary 
            Review and approve the project as submitted.</p>
          <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gayle Keck - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>
          <p>- They are in complete agreement that if the project 
            sponsor agrees to install a skylight in their home, they would agree 
            with the project.</p>
          <p>- They have not received a response regarding 
            the request to install the skylight.</p>
          <p>- She purchased the house about 20 years ago.</p>
          <p>- The window in the bathroom is the only window 
            on that side of the house.</p>
          <p>- She and her husband had to move away from San 
            Francisco but rented the house.</p>
          <p>- The renters are really concerned about the light 
            that will be lost from that window.</p>
          <p>- If they were forced to pay for the skylight 
            themselves, they would have to raise the rent and this is something 
            they do not want to do.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(-) Paul Herman</font></p>
          <p>- He read a letter from the tenant that is currently 
            renting the property who requested that a skylight be installed because 
            otherwise the proposed project would block light and air to the bathroom.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(+) Claire Pitcher - Representing Project Sponsor</font></p>
          <p>- The Discretionary Review requestor submitted 
            a bid and the cost for the skylight would be $16,500 - this is not 
            reasonable.</p>
          <p>- She requested that the Planning Commission take 
            Discretionary Review and approve the project as presented by the project 
            sponsor.</p>
          <p>ACTION: Take Discretionary Review and required 
            the project sponsor to pay up to $3,000 for the installation of a 
            skylight. Payment shall be upon proof of installation.</p>

                  No. 2003.09.19.5267, proposing to construct a horizontal and 
                  vertical addition to an existing two-family dwelling in an RH-2

          <p><font class="heading2">(-) Susan Taggart</font></p>
          <p>- This Discretionary Review is just about preserving 
            the open space.</p>
          <p>- Land for gardens is at a premium.</p>
          <p>- They want to keep development into the open 
            space at a minimum.</p>
          <p>- Her aunt purchased the house recently so she 
            is very interested in what is built.</p>
          <p>- There are no buildings that match the project 
            sponsor's project.</p>
          <p>- Because there is a flat roof, the height of 
            the extension would be extremely high.</p>
          <p>- Bring the extension back 4 feet or remove about 
            54 feet of living space form the proposed project. Require that all 
            roofs be fire rated and metal railings to be kept as parapets.</p>
          <p>- They are not asking to change much.</p>
          <p>- We are proposing these very small changes.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jean Taggart</font></p>
          <p>- She is Susan's aunt and is 85 years old.</p>
          <p>- The project would block sunlight to her property 
            and eliminate her privacy.</p>
          <p>- Being next to her niece and nephew-in-law makes 
            her very happy.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(-) Lol Hansen</font></p>
          <p>- He lives on the same block where the proposed 
            project will be located.</p>
          <p>- The block that they live on has very modest 
            houses.</p>
          <p>- Most of the lots there have gardens, trees, 
            shrubs.</p>
          <p>- The addition is inappropriate for what is on 
            their block.</p>
          <p>- To him, the project was shocking.</p>
          <p>- There are also concerns of privacy.</p>
          <p><font class="heading2">(+) Steven Step - Project Architect</font></p>
          <p>- He displayed a diagram of the proposed project.</p>
          <p>- The units are not very large.</p>
          <p>- The biggest issue is how they work with the 
            neighborhood and how to appeal to their concerns.</p>
          <p>ACTION: Do not take Discretionary Review and approved 
            the project.</p>
