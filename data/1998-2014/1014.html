    <ul><ul><p>6.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner William Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Local 21 - Their letter indicating their participation in response to the Budget Analyst's Audit Recommendations</i></p>

        <p>-  He asked the Director of Planning if he was in agreement with this?</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Demolition Permits</i></p>

        <p>He had a meeting with the head of the Department of Building Inspection regarding Jake McGoldrick's ordinance on demolition.  He would like to have the Director of the Department of Building Inspection come to the Commission and give his comments.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Discretionary Reviews</i></p>

        <p>If there are any discretionary reviews they should go before a community board before coming before the Commission.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Inappropriate public comment</i></p>

        <p>- The comments by the public have been pertinent to the matters at hand and have been very respectful yet there was a situation last week when comments were made that were not very proper.  Personal attacks do not have a place on this Commission.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Cover Memos</i></p>

        <p>- She wanted to thank Matt Snyder, from staff,  for providing cover memos from projects that have been calendared but continued.  This helps the Commission a lot.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Inclusionary Units</i></p>

        <p>- If inclusionary units rented at  60% of median income are later converted to condominiums, the sales price is set at 100% of AMI.  She would like the Commission to work with the Mayor's Office of Housing to not displace people who live in rental units that are converted to ownership housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commission Secretary</font></p>

        <p>- Reminded the Commission that that their Economic Interest forms are due by April 1, 2003.  Commissioners who were appointed prior to October 1, 2002 are required to submit this form.  Commissioners who were appointed after October 1, 2002 do not need to submit this form for this year.</p>

        <p>- There is a publication in Commissioners' correspondence folders called &quot;Planning Made Easy.&quot;  This publication is made available by the Friends of Planning.</p>

        <p>- Information brought back by Commissioner Feldstein when she attended a training class at UC Davis will be copied and distributed to the Commission.</p>

        <p>- A document that Commissioner Bradford Bell submitted to me called &quot;Building Work Force Housing, Meeting San Francisco's Challenge&quot; will also be copied and distributed to all commissioners.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>7. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Vacation</i></p>

        <p>- He is glad to be back from vacation.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Item taken off the calendar</i></p>

        <p>- He requested the amendment of the calendar because he would like to be more prepared to present this item.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Local 21 Letter and Audit</i></p>

        <p>- He has not seen the letter that Commissioner William Lee spoke about.  He would like to see it before he comments on it.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Broadcast of Hearings </i></p>

        <p>- The Broadcast of the hearings will have to cease because of budget constraints.</p>

        <p>- Friends of Planning will give us a grant of $4,500 that will fund the next three hearings.</p>

        <p>The Zoning Administrator (ZA) commented on the following items:</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Major Exterior Alterations Legislation - proposed by Supervisor McGoldrick</i></p>

        <p>- As the ZA he expressed some concerns about this legislation.</p>

        <p>- He spoke with Director Chu of the Building Department who also has some concerns. </p>

        <p>- They both spoke to Supervisor McGoldrick who indicated that he is willing to address the concerns.</p>

        <p>- The legislation might be presented to the Commission with modifications, or it might come with recommendations for modifications.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Community Boards for Discretionary Reviews</i></p>

        <p>- He has met with Donna Salazar who is the Director of Community Boards.</p>

        <p>- Very soon he will bring to the Commission recommendations on how to improve the Discretionary Review process.</p>

        <p><i>RE:  Commissioner Feldstein's comment about inclusionary housing's  unforeseen impact</i></p>

    <p>- She is here in opposition to this project.</p>

    <p>- Since January 13, 2003, she has been unable to come to an agreement with the project sponsor.  They met with the project sponsor's architect but were unsuccessful in reaching an agreement.</p>

    <p>- There were a few meetings with community boards but still there was no agreement.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dan Wolf - Lerner and Associates</font></p>

    <p>- There has been a considerable amount of time devoted to an alternate plan but there has not been any agreement.</p>

    <p>- He displayed diagrams of alternate plans.</p>

    <p>- The proposed project is out of context with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jeff Berzan</font></p>

    <p>- There was a meeting scheduled with the project sponsor.  There was an alternate plan but there was no agreement.</p>

    <p>- There was continual contact with the architect over a period of a month, but there was no agreement.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ginger Rhea</font></p>

    <p>- This neighborhood is very close in showing support for the Discretionary Review requestor.</p>

    <p>- This house is too tall and is out of context with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- She hopes the Commission will understand their position.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Christopher Pederson</font></p>

    <p>- This house is a four-story house and is very out of character with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- It is difficult to build a four-story house and be in keeping with the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- He hopes the Commission will listen to the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Richard Petrocchi</font></p>

    <p>- A speaker mentioned that the owners lived in Marin County.  That is not true.  He and his wife have been living in San Francisco for many years.  The parents of his wife have owned the property for many years.</p>

    <p>- This is not a monster home.  He would like to get along with the neighbors.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Stephen Antanaros</font></p>

    <p>- He was surprised by the plans that the DR requestors submitted to him.</p>

    <p>- He displayed diagrams of how the proposed house would look and show that this is not a monster house.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Fred Snyder</font></p>

    <p>- The City really needs housing at this time.  This project has been going on for way too long.</p>

    <p>- There is a mix of housing units in this area.</p>

    <p>- There was a speaker who spoke recently at a Planning Commission hearing who is not able to come to the hearing because he passed away - David McGuire.</p>

    <p>- He hopes the Commission will not go backwards and start approving projects on a project-by-project basis just because &quot;a project is better than no project.&quot;</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Oscar Grande - PODER/MAC</font><br>
- These industrial areas need a higher threshold, there should be more community benefits.</p>

    <p>- The private market should be expected, directed and required to meet the housing goals that are coming out of the Department's Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- Please don't be like the old Planning Commission by approving bad projects just to have a project instead of none.</p>

    <p>- Affordable housing is very important.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Charlie Siamas</font></p>

    <p>- There is a lot of data in front of the Planning Commission.</p>

    <p>- There were about 40 people who spoke last week in favor of affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor</font></p>

    <p>- She submitted information to the Commission regarding live/work units near the proposed site that included the sale price is of each of the units.  </p>

    <p>- There are needs that the neighborhood has and the Commission should listen to them.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Elizabeth Shepard - Chapman and Shepard, Inc.</font></p>

    <p>- She displayed a worksheet regarding the Construction Loan Underwriting which states that if there is a further decrease in income, it goes below the threshold required to fund the project.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Casner - Bond Street Capitol</font></p>

    <p>- He has reviewed the financial information from the sponsors for underwriting purposes and has determined that the project sponsor cannot afford to reduce the affordable income level or increase the number of low-income units.</p>

    <p>- According to his calculations and scenarios, the project sponsor would have to invest one million dollars more, which he does not have, in order to make the project more affordable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Cristina Olague - Mission Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- She reminded the Commission that when they make a decision on this project, they should take into consideration all the people that are living in SRO hotels, and those who cannot afford to live in high-priced units.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Teresa Almaguen</font></p>

    <p>- There were about 40 families here last week that told the Commission what their needs are.</p>

    <p>- About 80% of the people in the Mission pay rent and have low-income jobs.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Cris Zielig - MAC</font></p>

    <p>- There has been a lot of talk about whether or not the project sponsor can afford to invest more money on this project.  What is matters here is that the project sponsor owns the land and this is industrial land.</p>

    <p>- The Commission needs to question these numbers that are being presented.</p>

    <p>- She urged the Commission to think long-term planning, and think of the needs of the community.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- The housing problems deal more with supply.</p>

    <p>- Even though the interest rates are low right now, it does not mean they will stay that way.  Interest rates are going up.</p>

    <p>- The project sponsor's are not builders.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Geri Almanza - PODER</font></p>

    <p>- There is a need for an increase in family housing--two to three bedrooms (a unit); affordability to be at 40% AMI; a guarantee that once apartments become condos that they be available to the people living in the building.</p>

    <p>- They have been working with the Planning Department for the last three years trying to put forth a planning process.  They are not trying to put any burden on the developers or any burden on the demand the City has.  The demand is that people, students, and workers want affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- The project sponsor is currently building affordable units just across the street.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Reuben - Reuben and Alter</font></p>

    <p>- He asked the Commission not to open the issue of affordable housing again.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ramona Davies - Northern California Presbyterian Homes and Services</font></p>

        <p>- She supports the vision and the plan of the Rainbow Adult Housing Community since they are interested in parcels P and O as one entity rather than two parcels.</p>

        <p>- However, they would like the plan modified to accommodate their vision for a center  that will provide senior housing and services for the LGBT community.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Norman Rolfe - Member of the Central Freeway Advisory Committee</font></p>

        <p>- The plan is generally quite good it will be in an urban neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- Regarding the parking requirements: he does urge the Commission to do what is recommended -- make 1 for 1 the maximum and have no minimum.  If zero parking is wanted then that should be done.</p>

        <p>- The club strongly supports this plan.</p>

        <p>- This plan goes &quot;back to the future,&quot; before people opened their stores even without parking.</p>

        <p>- It is not necessary to provide parking.  Transit will not work if parking is constantly provided.</p>

        <p>- He reviewed the draft and wants to complement staff for producing such an excellent, readable document.</p>

        <p>- He encouraged the height of 50 feet around Octavia but the remaining three faces (the uphill side of Fell, uphill side of Oak and all of Laguna) be at the 40-foot height limit.</p>

        <p>- He looks forward to seeing this come together sooner than later.</p>

        <p>- He commended staff on this plan.</p>

        <p>- He recommended a few changes to the plan regarding the 50-foot height restrictions on certain areas because it will be out-of-character with the other buildings on the street.</p>

        <p>- He asked that there not be an extension of Hickory Alley.  A pedestrian green belt would make more sense.</p>

        <p>- He supports the provisions of the plan to limit parking.</p>

        <p>- He has read the plan and is very supportive of the plan because it really and truly deals with the issues of the neighbors.</p>

        <p>- This plan really reflects the outcome of the community meetings.</p>

        <p>- The reduction of parking and density are very important aspects of the plan.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Jim Haas - Chairman of Civic Pride</font></p>

        <p>- The proposed plan is an excellent plan for an enhanced residential neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- There are institutions that people attend.  They come from outside of the city and drive cars.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about the people who drive cars into the area.</p>

        <p>- The plan needs to be amended to include these institutions.</p>

        <p>- The Civic Center area has many uses:  residential, State and Federal employees, and the regional center for performing arts.</p>

        <p>- When a study like this is done, peak times should be taken into account.</p>

        <p>- There are hundreds of people who are already on public transportation, yet during peak performing arts periods people drive to the Civic Center.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) John Keazer - Director of Electronic Media for the San Francisco Symphony</font></p>

        <p>- He asks that the parking situation be looked at closely because the performing arts patrons and institutions would be affected.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about the reports related to parking and traffic.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Ron Miguel</font></p>

        <p>- He complemented staff on the manner in which this plan has been handled.  </p>

        <p>- The community input has been incredible.</p>

        <p>- This is a very unusual neighborhood. One that will ask for increased density and reduced parking.</p>

        <p>- He realizes that the Civic Center would have an issue with parking.</p>

        <p>- They are thrilled with this plan.</p>

        <p>- The Department is doing a great job on educating the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The plan is very specific; the zoning is very clear, etc.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Heather Thomson - Transportation for a Livable City</font></p>

        <p>- Her organization supports this plan completely.</p>

        <p>- This plan will increase housing density while improving traffic and transit issues.</p>

        <p>- She urges the Commission to support this plan as well.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marcy Adelman - Rainbow Adult Community Housing</font></p>

        <p>- Housing in support of the LGBT elder population is very important.</p>

        <p>- The plan generally reflects the desires of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- Her concerns are related to Parcels O and P.</p>

        <p>- The plan, as now written, subdivides these parcels preventing the possibility of creating a mixed-used, community-serving hub as they envision.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Clark Seally - Rainbow Adult Community Housing</font></p>

        <p>- The plan is confusing about the division of Parcels O and P.</p>

        <p>- Subdividing these parcels will prevent the opportunity of creating a community-serving organization.</p>

        <p>- There are plans for an expansion of their housing organization.</p>

        <p>- She would like the Market Street/Octavia Street plan be revised to allow flexibility for expanding organizations.</p>

        <p>- She is a senior who is a lesbian and would like to live in a place where she will be able to feel comfortable with other seniors who share her same ideas.</p>

        <p>- She asked the Commission to support senior housing in the Market Street area.</p>

        <p>- The plans for parcels O and P would make it difficult for the ROCK organization to expand.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Nolan Madson - Hay Valley Resident</font></p>

        <p>- Although there are a number of details to be addressed, this is an excellent plan.</p>

        <p>- He supports the ROCK project and recommends that parcels O and P not be combined.</p>

        <p>- He fears the boring loft condos developers will build in the area if lots are divided.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jan Faulkner - Rainbow Adult Community Housing</font></p>

        <p>- She supports what the pervious speakers have said.</p>

        <p>- She recently moved to San Francisco after living in Berkley.  She moved to San Francisco to live closer to her community, yet she would have loved to move into her community.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Patricia Walkup - Friends of Octavia Boulevard</font></p>

        <p>- There are very few green spaces where people can congregate.</p>

        <p>- Streets and sidewalks should be able to be used for people to congregate.</p>

        <p>- The parking requirement should be reduced for new developments.</p>

        <p>- Storefronts are needed and not just blank garages as some of the more recent developments have.</p>

        <p>- Transit first is very important for Van Ness and Mission Streets.</p>

        <p>- She asked the Commission to support these elements because without them the plan does not work.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Nancy Brundy - Institute on Aging</font></p>

        <p>- They are here in support of the ROCK group--to not divide lots P and O.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will allow the flexibility to maximize the potential for this site.</p>

        <p>- He has attended almost all of the Better Neighborhoods workshops.</p>

        <p>- This plan is what the neighborhood has been waiting for many years.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that this plan is developed in the quickest way possible.</p>

        <p>- Housing is more important than garages.</p>

        <p>- He commends the Planning Department for listening to their needs.</p>

        <p>- This plan is excellent and she hopes that the pan goes forward.</p>

        <p>- Hopefully the developer will come up with a creative way to build there.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Calvin Welch - Council for Community Housing Organizations</font></p>

        <p>- His organization pushed the Mayor to fund this kind of planning.</p>

        <p>- They were the ones doing affordable housing in neighborhoods before the Planning Department did this.</p>

        <p>- They are very happy with this and happy to move forward with it.  They are delighted that many people support affordable housing, but he is stunned with the language in the plan.</p>

        <p>- All of the policies on affordable housing talk about home ownership in this document.</p>

        <p>- This document is not properly written.  This is not the policy of this Commission on this policy.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) George Orleas</font></p>

        <p>- He thanked the Commission for their time during these hearings.  He also thanked the community for coming out and making this plan work.</p>

        <p>-  Because there are a lot of seniors who are living on the street he supports senior affordable housing in this area.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sean Kiegran</font></p>

        <p>- Housing is sacrificed to satisfy this 1 to 1 ration for parking.</p>

The project proposes demolition of three existing two- to six-story structures on the project site, totaling about 173,650 gross square feet (gsf), and the building of a 58-story, 605 foot-tall, mixed userdevelopment, totaling about 1,156,500 gsf.  The net change in area for the site would be an increase of about 982,850 gsf.  The proposed development would contain about 130,560 gsf of office space; a 120-suite extended-stay hotel (about 164,800 gsf); 320 residential units (about 551,000 gsf); ground-floor retail and restaurant space (about 9,400 gsf); a publicly accessible atrium (about 6,400 gsf); and lobbies (about 4,340 gsf).  Building services would occupy about 33,400 gsf and mechanical space would occupy about 104,840 gsf.  There would be three off-street loading docks and four off-street van spaces, and 400 spaces of underground parking and vehicular circulation on four levels (about 151,760 gsf).  The site includes Lots 1 and 17 on Assessor's Block 3719.  The project requires approval as new construction in a C-3 District under Planning Code Section 309; a Bulk Limits:  Special Exceptions in C-3 District authorization under Section 272; a Height Limits:  Special Exception for Upper Tower Extensions in S Districts authorization under Section 263.9; Conditional Use authorization for a Major (Nonaccessory) Parking Garage Not Open to the Public under Section 223(p); Conditional Use authorization for Hotel Use in a C-3-O District under Section 216(c);  transfer of development rights in a C-3 District authorization under Section 128; a lot line adjustment to merge the existing lots by the Public Works Department; and approval by the Board of Supervisors to eliminate the mid-block pedestrian crosswalk across Fremont Street between Mission and Natoma Streets. </p>

        <p>- Whatever extensions the jobs create, the burden on social services would fall on the City.  He is concerned with the jobs created by this project.</p>

        <p>- There are a number of concerns beyond section 303 (of the code).  In particular, this project needs to be considered closely in context of the Transbay Terminal development and the Cal Train station.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Leticia Redondo</font></p>

        <p>- She is concerned about her kitchen window because the proposed property will block her main source of daylight.  This would cause her to use electric light all day.</p>

        <p>- Garages are intended to house cars, not people.  It would just take a simple stove, microwave or hot place to make the downstairs unit into an apartment.</p>

        <p>- His concern is more about the entire structure because it will block out light to his whole house--not just his kitchen.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Chris Cole</font></p>

        <p>- He displayed a large model showing other ways to build the project by not impacting the DR requestor.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ches Herbert</font></p>

        <p>- He gets a lot of sunlight into his home and his yard.  The proposed project would block this sunlight.</p>

        <p>- The proposed alternation in the back is no less disruptive.</p>

        <p>- He also recommended reducing the pitched roof, therefore reducing the height even more.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bobbi Frioli</font></p>

        <p>- She is concerned with privacy issues.  Staff has done a great job to revise the project to deal with the neighbor's issues.  However, she is still concerned with all the windows on the side of her house.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Lewis Goldhammer</font></p>

        <p>- The issues he has are related to the audacity of this proposal--the project sponsor has taken advantage of the rear neighbor.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor is trying to push the envelope and go as far as he can.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard Katz</font></p>

        <p>- There have been a lot of changes in the San Francisco area.</p>

        <p>- His major concerns are that this project would change the character of the neighborhood, and it doesn't respect the blockface of the street.</p>

        <p>- This is a bad project for the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- His wife suffers from SAD and it is important to receive all the sunlight as possible.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) William Walters - Project Architect</font></p>

        <p>- He commended staff for a great job on this project.</p>

        <p>- He has had an architectural practice in Potrero Hill for about 15 years.</p>

        <p>- The current house has been deteriorating for a long time.</p>

        <p>- About five years ago the project sponsor came to him with an idea to demolish the house and rebuild it.</p>

        <p>- The proposed design is similar to structures on the opposite side of the street.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Pete Loskotoff</font></p>

        <p>- He was born and raised in the Potrero Hill area.</p>

        <p>- This project is not going to hurt anybody.  The views are not blocked.  The City would be benefited if this project is approved.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bill Canihan</font></p>

        <p>- His family was born and raised in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- There is a firehouse behind the subject property.</p>

        <p>- He feels challenged that the neighbors say that this project is out of scale with the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The upper level is important to him.  He is willing to change the windows on the south side, willing to change materials, etc.  He has been working for several years to try to meet the concerns of the neighbors.</p>
