    <ul><ul><p>5. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

      <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Scheduling Cases in September</i></p>

      <p>- In an effort to explore ways to better prioritize the Commission calendar, she instructed the Commission Secretary to implement a trial procedure in September only that would calendar Discretionary Review cases on a date by themselves and all other cases on alternate hearing dates.  In essence, every other Thursday would be for Discretionary Review and the alternate Thursdays would items that are usually on our regular calendar.  In early October the Commission would have to calendar an item that would allow us to discuss and analyze the effectiveness of this trial procedure and determine whether or not we want to continue, modify, or abandon it.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Miscellaneous Questions</i></p>

      <p>- What EIR's are coming up in September?</p>

      <p>- Can the Housing Element be scheduled as a special meeting again?</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Director Green's departure</i></p>

      <p>- She requested to have scheduled on the next agenda, the issue of Director Green's imminent departure and to get clarity and a status report on what the interim management team for the Department is while he is gone.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Receiving Informational/briefing material in a timely manner</i></p>

      <p>- She would like informational/briefing material at least one week prior to the hearing instead of the evening before the hearing.  This way Commissioners are better prepared to make decisions on the cases before us.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

      <p>She requested the following information:</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Workload:</i></p>

      <p>- Calendar a discussion about workload and calendar preparation.  In that discussion, we should explore ways of better managing the calendar, which might include more direct commissioner input into calendar preparation.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Timeliness:</i></p>

      <p>- She will be requesting that items be continued if she does not receive updated information in a timely manner.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Scheduling:</i></p>

      <p>- Only under emergency circumstances should more than one meeting be scheduled in a week.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Feedback:</i></p>

      <p>- She would like to receive the action list (which contains Commissioner's requests) no less than once a month, or whenever any item on it changes, whichever is more frequent.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Planning vs. Projects:</i></p>

      <p>- She requested that from this point forward presentations about true planning issues be allocated as much time as the presenters need to make complete presentations.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Director:</i></p>

      <p>- She would like to schedule on the calendar the issue of the Commission be given the opportunity for input into the process of who the managing staff will be as Director Green leaves the position of Planning Director.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Discretionary Reviews:</i></p>

      <p>- Some months ago, the Commission began to discuss streamlining the Discretionary Review process.  She requested that this item be calendared for discussion to move the issue forward.</p>

      <p><i>Re: 11x17 plans</i></p>

      <p>- She instructed that project sponsors be responsible for providing to staff/Commission 20 copies of project plans that are 11''x17.''</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

      <p>- He agrees with what Commissioners have said.  He feels that these are items that need to be addressed.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Informational material in a timely manner</i></p>

      <p>- He understands that projects are constantly changing that requires updates that need to be sent to Commissioners via faxes/phone calls, often on the morning of a hearing.  He feels that Commissioners just need to do the best they can to review that material.  Although he agrees that the earlier they can get the material, the better.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

      <p>- He also agrees with the request made by Commissioners regarding getting information in a timely manner.</p>

      <p>- Site visits and presentations take a lot of time so scheduling this in a timely manner will help to organize the Commission's calendars.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bill Lee:</font></p>

      <p>- He understands the amount of time that Commissioners need and the economic impact.  He feels that having more Commission meetings are a good idea.  He realizes that Saturdays are a religious holidays for some and that Sundays City Hall is closed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Items that get continued</i></p>

      <p>- He realizes that there are some continuations that the Commission can control and some that they cannot.</p>

      <p>- He advised project sponsor representatives to do their work well.</p>

</ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>6. Director's Announcements</p>

      <blockquote><p><i>Re:  Efficiency</i></p>

      <p>- There are a lot of factors involved to receiving information in a timely/efficient manner.  The department will do their part on this matter.</p>

      <p>Re:  Alternating DRs and Regular Items:</p>

      <p>- The department is fast approaching dates to get things noticed for future hearings.  He will act on this quickly.</p>

    </blockquote><p>7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

      <p><i>Re:  3725 Buchanan Street</i></p>

      <p>Appeal of a CU authorizing 8 panel antennas and related equipment on the roof of an existing building as part of Verizon's wireless telecommunications network. (Approved +4-3 on May 1, 2003 by the Commission). The Board did not feel that the antennae were necessary and desirable, and the CU was overturned on an 11-0 vote. </p>

      <p><i>Re:  40-50 Lansing Street</i></p>

      <p>CU appeal of this 82-unit residential project.</p>

      <p>The Board voted to change the building envelope on the Lansing Street side of the building by eliminating 4 units there. Additionally, they amended the project to place the loading dock on-site as opposed to across the street, which eliminated a total of 5 dwelling units in the building. The total number of units therefore was reduced from 82 to 77, which includes the loss of an affordable unit--reduced from 10 affordable units in the original project to 9 in the revised project. Assuming that the project sponsor keeps the same 70/30% ratio on the type of affordable units as they reflect the total number of units, this will mean a loss of 1 affordable two-bedroom unit.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  3537 19TH ST (19<sup>th</sup> Street PG&amp;E transformer)</i></p>

      <p>Appeal of the CU to authorize six antennas and backup equipment located on the building's rooftop for AT&amp;T Wireless. Appealed by neighborhood signatures.  This project was overturned by an 8-1 vote, with Supervisor Peskin dissenting.</p>

    <p>- They had proposed a three unit building and his client is asking for 
      two commercial areas and the two residential units at the top levels. This 
      would bring the required parking to two spaces.</p>
    <p>- Therefore the project has been modified.</p>

    <p>- She would like to delay the EIR approval because rushing into the approval 
      would delay and make things more complicated.</p>
    <p>- There have been comments put into the document.</p>
    <p>- The EIR should be approved based on what the Commissioner reads and not 
      on what people say.</p>

    <p>- She asks that the Commission act today and certify the EIR.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Wade Randal</font></p>
    <p>- The expeditious approval of the EIR is critical.</p>
    <p>- There is a strong majority of San Franciscans that want this garage built 
      and want the pedestrian access to the music concourse.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Gwyneth Borden - SF Chamber of Commerce</font></p>
    <p>- It is important to implement what the voters asked for.</p>
    <p>- Having the cars in a garage will eliminate fumes from cars looking around 
      for parking near the park.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Tomasita Medal - Park Access for All</font></p>
    <p>- The tunnels are dark and uninviting. Usually they smell like urine.</p>
    <p>- She urges the Commission to certify the EIR today.</p>
    <p><font class="heading2">John Laskin</font></p>
    <p>- If he were a developer he would build parking in high-rises.</p>
    <p>- He is not against the garage but would like a better proposal.</p>
    <p><i>Re: 201 Folsom/300 Spear</i></p>
    <p><font class="heading2">Michael Nulty</font></p>

      <ul><p><u>CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES PROJECT</u> - Planning Commission Finding Regarding Planning Code Section 295 (&quot;Sunlight Ordinance&quot;).  The project is located along Academy Drive in Golden Gate Park, south side of the street and bounded by the Music Concourse to the north, the Rhododendron Dell to the east, the Shakespeare Garden to the west and Middle Drive East to the south, Lot 001 in Assessor's Block 1700 in a P (Public) District and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.  Construction of a new California Academy of Sciences (CAS) building on the site of the existing facility in Golden Gate Park is proposed.  The project includes demolition of 11 of 12 existing buildings, and would retain Simson Africa Hall.  The project proposes a new building, contiguous with a rehabilitated Africa Hall, housing the Academy's facilities in one structure.  The new CAS building would have a varying roof height ranging from approximately 40 feet to 67 feet in height.  Section 295 of the Planning Code requires, prior to approval of the project, that a determination be made that shading from the structure will not have a significant and adverse effect on lands under the jurisdiction of the Recreation and Park Department.  The Commission shall make its determination following a recommendation by the Recreation and Park Commission .  (Action by the Planning Commission.)</p>

      <p>- Although there are shadow impacts, they are impacts on roadways and pathways and they are very insignificant.</p>

      <p>- The concerns he has are that the floor plan is at a higher elevation and there are no handrails which has significant impact for pedestrians.  There are concerns that pedestrians on wheels will have a hard time maneuvering in the Academy.</p>

      <p>- He is surprised that the project sponsor did not contact him.</p>

      <p>- He would like the Commission to put off a vote until the neighbors have been contacted.</p>

      <p>- The project has a monstrous size roof deck; he is concerned with the landscaping, etc.</p>

      <p>- His issues are related to noise and privacy.</p>

      <p>- He asked that the rear yard be made into a green open space by removing the existing brick and concrete pavement.</p>

      <p>- There is no existing deck on the project.</p>

      <p>- If the deck would be allowed, he asked that it be reduced in size.</p>

      <p>- He never received notice of this project.</p>

      <p>- This project represents a decrease in density.</p>

    <p>- The question here is what type of document the Commission will be putting out.</p>

    <p>- The tunnels are deteriorating beyond repair.</p>

    <p>- He urges the Commission to get the document correct before approving it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Greg Miller</font></p>

    <p>- He is a strong advocate for preserving all the trees when this project is constructed.</p>

    <p>- The EIR does address the issue of the trees.  It states that the removal of the trees will not constitute an impairment of the landmark status.</p>

    <p>- He recommended that the Commission look at this closely.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Katherine Howard - ASLA Historic Preservation - Landscape Architect</font></p>

    <p>- The draft EIR states that the landscaping of the project will remove many trees.</p>

    <p>- The trees are of historic significance and should be preserved.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mary Anne Miller</font></p>

    <p>- She believes that the tunnels are a historic resource.</p>

    <p>- In the document, it states that the trees are a historic resource.</p>

    <p>- She requested that the Commission make a finding today on the issue of the pedestrian tunnels.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Chappell - President of SPUR</font></p>

    <p>- The job of the Commission is to determine if the EIR is accurate and complete.  There is no question that this document is complete and should be certified.</p>

    <p>- The trees are not part of the project response.  Removal of the trees is not part of the project.</p>

    <p>- The tunnels will be eliminated for new 21<sup>st</sup> century use.</p>

    <p>- There will be an improvement on the traffic impact.</p>

    <p>- He is in favor of parking garages.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Nancy Conner - Golden Gate Concourse Authority</font></p>

    <p>- Since May of 1999, there have been meetings at City Hall; there have been neighborhood design meetings, etc.</p>

    <p>- She also loves trees but the plan that is referenced in the comments and responses is not part of the document that is up for certification today.</p>

    <p>- She is also concerned of what the park will look like in the future.</p>

    <p>- She feels that the garage solution is inconspicuous, effective and will be a great boom for future generations.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Carolyn Blair - SF Tree Council - Urban Forest Council Member</font></p>

    <p>- She is confused because the Environmental Impact Report states the removal of the trees.</p>

    <p>- The public has clearly made it known that there is a concern about the trees.</p>

    <p>- She would like to have removed the statements related to the removal of trees before the document is certified.</p>

    <p>- This process has not been going as well as proponents have tried to make the Commission believe.</p>

    <p>- Right now there is a will, so now the Commission needs to find the way.</p>

    <p>- The EIR should be brought up to what was promised.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Michael Burke</font></p>

    <p>- The Commission is not approving a particular project.  What is before the Commission is if the document should be certified or not.</p>

    <p>- No one is proposing to remove any trees from the Concourse.</p>

    <p>- There are now 85 holes where trees have died, these trees would be replaced if the project is implemented.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Catherine Roberts</font></p>

    <p>- She is glad that the Commission rejected this EIR.</p>

    <p>- This is a public park and there are public resources at stake here.</p>

    <p>- She is really concerned with pedestrian safety.</p>

    <p>- She is concerned that parking spaces will be taken out from the park and there is no indication of where they will be put.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Josey Mooney - President of the San Francisco Labor Council</font></p>

    <p>- She urged the Commission to certify the EIR.</p>

    <p>- Everyone should be able to have access to the park.  It is important for families to come to the park by car and park there.</p>

      <ul><p><u>GOLDEN GATE PARK CONCOURSE AUTHORITY PROJECTS</u> - <font class="heading2">Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)</font> - The site is between the California Academy of Sciences and the M.H. de Young Museum in Golden Gate Park, called the Music Concourse area.  In 1998, voters of San Francisco approved Proposition J, Golden Gate Park Revitalization Act, to improve the landscape and pedestrian environment of the Music Concourse area.  Phase I of the proposed project would include an underground parking facility of 800 to 1,000 spaces at the Music Concourse, surface improvements, and transportation improvements in the Concourse area, and throughout Golden Gate Park, as described in Proposition J.  Proposition J requires removal of surface parking spaces from the Concourse area, and in locations throughout the Park, equivalent to the number of spaces provided in the new underground parking facility upon completion of the parking facility. In addition to the underground parking facility, the Transportation Implementation Plan includes the following elements: intra-park shuttle, cultural shuttle, traffic calming, parking management, bicycle and pedestrian improvements, road closures, and MUNI service improvements. Phase II of the project would entail construction of an Underground Through Street connecting Fulton Street to Middle Drive East, which would allow for through traffic to be restricted or eliminated from Tea Garden Drive and Academy Drive. The proposed underground roadway would ramp down at Eighth Avenue at Kennedy Drive and would extend beneath the east end of the Concourse and alongside the east side of the California Academy of Sciences, where it would ramp up to Middle Drive East.  This underground street would not provide access into the parking garage and would be intended to reduce cross-park vehicular traffic through the Music Concourse.  The project site is within the P (Public Use) zoning district and within an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District; Assessor's Block 1700, Lot 1.</p>

      <p>Since publication of the Draft EIR, the Executive Director of the Project Sponsor, Concourse Authority, notified the Planning Department that the preferred project as analyzed in the DEIR has been revised.  The project, as revised, consists of Phase I, the Underground Parking Facility, and the Transportation Improvement Measures (&quot;TIP&quot;), both as analyzed as part of the preferred project in the DEIR.  Phase II, the Underground Through Street, has been severed from the project and removed from further consideration.  As a consequence, the preferred project, as revised, is Phase I and the TIP elements only.  This project was identified in the DEIR as Alternative B.  With the severance of Phase II, the project, as revised, has no physical environmental impact on the historic character of the Rhododendron Dell, an area of Golden Gate Park considered individually eligible for listing on the California Register of Historical Resources.  As a result, the project, as revised, has eliminated the significant unavoidable impact to this resource that was identified in the DEIR.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Certify the EIR as a Final EIR.  Please note the public review period for the DEIR ended at 5:00 pm, February 5, 2003. <font class="heading2">Public hearing has been closed.</font></p>

      <p><u>201 FOLSOM STREET</u> - <font class="heading2">Certification of Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR) - </font>The rezoning of parcels in the Rincon Hill neighborhood (the &quot;rezoning project&quot;) and a residential development of approximately 1,500,000 gross square feet (gsf) at 201 Folsom Street (the &quot;development&quot; project).  The property is currently used as a paved parking lot by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Annex and other government agencies for 270 vehicles.  The rezoning project includes rezoning part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 and Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High-Density) with a 300- and 400-foot height limit.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial sub-district under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the <i>Rincon Hill Area Plan</i>, a part of the <i>San Francisco General Plan</i>.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with development proposed at 300 Spear Street on Assessor's Block 3745, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 725 residential units (about 825,000 gsf) and about 38,000 gsf of retail space.  It would include about 753 enclosed parking spaces and four loading spaces for the use of the development, and about 272 enclosed replacement parking spaces for the use of the USPS and other government agencies.  An 80-foot-tall building base would cover the site.  Two residential towers would rise above the building base to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level.  The project would require a subdivision of Lot 1 to separate the development site from the Postal Service Annex.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Chappell - President of SPUR</font></p>

      <p>- He has read and studied the EIRs in reasonable detail and he is confident that they are adequate and correct and should be certified.</p>

      <p>- There is a terrible shortage of housing and this is causing families to leave the city.  </p>

      <p>- There are singles that are doubling, tripling and quadrupling in units because they cannot afford to live in single units.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that the Commission will certify the EIRs.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jeffrey Leibovitz</font></p>

      <p>- The EIRs only state that the projects will not shadow South Park.</p>

      <p>- Revenue needs to be captured from these projects.</p>

      <p>- The EIRs are not adequate addressing the impacts this will have on the Park and Recreation properties in the Rincon Hill neighborhoods.</p>

      <p>- The immediate parks don't have adequate facilities, and that is what he is asking the Commission to do.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Reed Bement - President of the Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association</font></p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to &quot;do the right thing&quot;.</p>

      <p>- He believes in this area and that is why he lives there.  This area should be developed.</p>

      <p>- These projects are not in a position to be developed.</p>

      <p>- There are still a lot of matters that have not been discussed in the EIRs.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Andrew Brooks - General Manager of Baycrest Residential Association</font></p>

      <p>- The Comment and Responses section of the EIR under the visual quality and urban design section shows photo simulations of alternatives B, C and D.  However, all of the viewpoint locations called for in the EIR were not added.</p>

      <p>- In the Transportation section of the EIR:  under the Intersection Operating Conditions, it states that turning movement volumes were counted prior to the closure of Beale Street.  CEQA requires the EIR to represent conditions as they currently exist at the time of evaluation and/or approval.  New updated figures need to be included to give an accurate representation of Intersection Levels of Service.  Under the Construction Traffic section, it states that the Giants Ballpark construction was not identified as a significant impact.  This response is not accurate and is in error.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Patrick Malone - Rincon Hill Residents </font></p>

      <p>- He is here to support the Rincon Hill neighbors and request that you not certify the EIR.</p>

      <p>- Public input has not been given and there is no comprehensive plan.</p>

      <p>- The EIR is insufficient because it fails to adequately address the cumulative affects on the construction of the projects.</p>

      <p>- It does not address the Bay Bridge retrofit project.</p>

      <p>- It does not address the traffic problems that were set by the 9/11 incident.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bobbie Carter</font></p>

      <p>- She lives in the SOMA area.</p>

      <p>- She is very concerned about the EIR.</p>

      <p>- One of the greatest concerns she has is the height of the buildings.  Forty stories will definitely impact the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- This is a very limited area in the city that should be preserved.</p>

      <p>- There are many issues that need to be addressed so she urges the Commission to not certify this document.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Henry Kleinhenz - Baycrest</font></p>

      <p>- Many of the residents who live in Rincon Hill are not against development or housing.</p>

      <p>- Whatever projects go on should conform to the existing density that is already established in the Rincon Hill plan.</p>

      <p>- He is very concerned that there will be four buildings that are too tall.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor</font></p>

      <p>- There is a lack of a plan or an analysis of this EIR.</p>

      <p>- The EIR slides over the issue that there is no plan.</p>

      <p>- There are other developments in the area which are either going on or are planned yet they are not mentioned in the EIR.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jo Howard</font></p>

      <p>- She asked the Commission to seriously look at the impact of changing the height limit for a specific project before Rincon Hill has been evaluated.</p>

      <p>- It is unfair to give the benefit to developers, to have more units with higher heights in the area.</p>

      <p>- The financial district is the financial district but this project is residential housing.</p>

The property is currently used as a paved parking lot for 290 vehicles.  The property was formerly owned by Caltrans and under lease to Golden Gate Transit for daytime commuter bus layovers. Golden Gate Transit buses were relocated a few blocks away in 2000.  The rezoning project includes rezoning Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, and part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 105, 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined:  High Density) with 300- and 400-foot height limits.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial subdistrict under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the Rincon Hill Area Plan, a part of the San Francisco General Plan.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with the proposed development at 201 Folsom Street on Assessor's Block 3746, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 820 residential units, about 36,000 gsf of retail and about 890 underground parking spaces.  Two 80-foot-tall building bases would be built to the property lines on Spear, Folsom and Main Streets; the building bases would surround a landscaped courtyard beginning at the courtyard (third) level.  Two residential towers would rise above the building bases to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level, respectively. </p>

      <p>- The San Francisco workforce needs a place to live.</p>

      <p>- Companies want to locate where they can find a good workforce.</p>

      <p>- All this cannot happen if the amount of housing is not increased.</p>

      <p>- The project will allow density in transit corridors.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Stan Warren - San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council</font></p>

      <p>- Various projects were constructed with the best craftsmanship.</p>

      <p>- These projects offer long-term benefits to the City.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Mike Theriault - Iron Workers Union</font></p>

      <p>- These are beautiful projects that will benefit the City greatly.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Doug Perry - Building and Construction Trades Council</font></p>

      <p>- The projects are good for the economy of the City as a whole.</p>

      <p>- Employment has declined and this project will provide quality jobs to many people.</p>

      <p>- San Francisco should maintain its regional importance in the Bay Area in regards to jobs.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Salinas - Carpenters Local 22</font></p>

      <p>- He is here representing thousands of carpenter union workers.</p>

      <p>- He is a strong advocate for this project because it will build more housing in the center of the City.</p>

      <p>- Currently there are thousands of units in deficit in the City.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jeff Leibovitz</font></p>

      <p>- He is not concerned about the loss of view he will have because of this project.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned about the process of this project.</p>

      <p>- He feels that this project will be appealed at the Board of Supervisors, so he asks that the Commission be very thoughtful in their deliberations.   The Commission needs to be ready to standup when the time comes when this project is appealed at the Board of Supervisors, otherwise this project is destined for failure.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rev. Arelious Walker - Faith Based Housing</font></p>

      <p>- Recently there were a number of units approved near the church where he is pastor.</p>

      <p>- He asks the developers of this project not to forget the low-income residents of the various neighborhoods in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- This project should be approved because it will allow affordable housing units.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rev. Ted Frazier</font></p>

      <p>- If there is housing in this area, it will not go to waste.</p>

      <p>- He is speaking in favor of these projects going forward.</p>

      <p>- He has not heard of anyone making history by doing nothing.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Carl Alexander</font></p>

      <p>- He would love to move back to San Francisco and this would be an opportunity to bring young folks back.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rev. Arnold Townsend - Faith Based Housing</font></p>

      <p>- Most of the points have been made.</p>

      <p>- This project is extremely important for San Francisco because there is a housing crisis going on.</p>

      <p>- Yes, this project is different but is beneficial.</p>

      <p>- It is important for working class folk to have the opportunity to purchase a home.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Alvin Selva - Bayview Hope Housing</font></p>

      <p>- He is in support of this project because it will allow he and his wife to own a home.</p>

      <p>- He and his wife make too much money to be allowed grants, but do not make enough to purchase market rate housing.</p>

      <p>- This location will allow for his family to be near homes and churches.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Ricardo Bell</font></p>

      <p>- He is a potential homebuyer.</p>

      <p>- He and his wife have been looking to purchase a home for the last three years and this project will give them an opportunity to do so.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Rev. Eugine Lumpkin</font></p>

      <p>- Almost every month people come to him announcing that they will be moving because they could not purchase a home.</p>

      <p>- He is looking forward to retiring and this would be an opportunity for him to purchase a home.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Dave Figueroa</font></p>

      <p>- He was born and raised in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- This project will be 100% union.</p>

      <p>- People that will live here will be able to walk or take public transportation to work.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Judith Patterson - South Bay/South Beach Citizen's Advisory Committee</font></p>

      <p>- She is a fourth generation San Franciscan.</p>

      <p>- Her husband and son work in the City.</p>

      <p>- She is in support of these projects if they are done correctly.</p>

      <p>- There's been no mention about schools in the neighborhood.  Most of the units are two bedrooms.  There are not that many units that have three bedrooms.</p>

      <p>- The public meetings were presentations, there was no room for creative thinking or talk about what the neighborhood wants or needs.</p>

      <p>- These buildings are too high.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Shawn Leonard - NCCRC</font></p>

      <p>- Rincon Hill is an underutilized neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- The project will give a boost to the local economy.</p>

      <p>- She urges the Commission to approve this project without further delay.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) George Williams - SPUR</font></p>

      <p>- What is proposed now is the next logical evolution of what was proposed in 1989.</p>

      <p>- These projects will provide lots of housing and are very well designed.</p>

      <p>- His concern is that there is a need to make Rincon Hill a real neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- What is needed is a sense of how the whole neighborhood will be improved.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Patrick Malone</font></p>

      <p>- Planners should plan for San Francisco and not for other cities.</p>

      <p>- Although there is a need to create union jobs, these projects will last forever and should not be taken lightly.</p>

      <p>- Development in Rincon Hill is necessary but this is just piece-meal rezoning of certain parcels.</p>

      <p>- He is asking to be part of the community planning process for this area.</p>

      <p>- This project is not good for the neighborhood.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Reed Bement - President of the Rincon Hill Neighborhood Association</font></p>

      <p>- He believes in high density housing but this area is not a &quot;waste land&quot;.</p>

      <p>- The area has developed quite nicely, but if there are to be improvements, they should be planned out intelligently.</p>

      <p>- The towers totally overwhelm everything in the area.</p>

      <p>- The towers will also create a visual block to people coming into the City.</p>

      <p>- There are still many problems to deal with.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Tim Tosta - Steefel, Levit and Weiss</font></p>

      <p>- There is a list of schools that are nearby.</p>

      <p>- They have carefully developed the plans for these projects over a number of years.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dorothy Dana</font></p>

      <p>- This project, of course, will provide jobs, low-income housing, etc.</p>

      <p>- This is not housing that will be affordable.</p>

      <p>- Spot zoning should not be allowed just because these units supposedly will be affordable.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bobbi Carter</font></p>

      <p>- She read a letter from Supervisor Chris Daly who is not supporting these projects.</p>

      <p>- She read a letter from a member of San Francisco Beautiful who is not in support of this project.</p>

      <p>- The area should be developed in a smart way.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor - Rincon Hill Residents Association</font></p>

      <p>- The last community meeting of Rincon Hill was July of 2001.  Nearly two years.  Yet according to the developers, they have been having monthly meetings with planning staff.</p>

      <p>- This is all backwards.  There is no comprehensive plan related to how pedestrians are going to move through this large area.</p>

      <p>- How is there going to be open and desirable space?</p>

      <p>- People are going to get in their cars and drive a couple of miles to get someplace and the Planning Department does not have a plan for this.</p>

The site is considered a Preference 2 under the City &amp; County of San Francisco's Wireless Telecommunications Services (WTS) Facilities Siting Guidelines, as it is a &quot;co-location&quot; site. However, due to a prior Planning Commission action and approved Motion No. 16084 for case no 2000.0385C the site had been deemed a Preference 6.  The Planning Commission will consider under which Preference (2 or 6) to review the application.
