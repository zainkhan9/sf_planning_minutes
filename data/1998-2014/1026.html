              <ul><ul><ul><p>Minutes for April 24, 2003 approved with the following corrections:  1) on page 1 - Commissioner Boyd was absent and he is stated as being present; 2) on page 7 - Jim Chappel is misspelled; 3) on page 12 - Jim Crowfoot is misspelled.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>7.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        <p>1) When the public submits information to the Commission that consists of hundreds of pages 36 hours before a hearing, it is absolutely impossible to expect Commissioners to have it read before the hearing.  Because she is very diligent and reads everything related to the hearing she requested and expects the public to submit their information at least one week before each hearing [as outlined by the Commission Secretary].</p>

        <p>2) Regarding the Housing Element and some of the other policies that are being reviewed by the Commission, she requested that staff report to them on the kind of regional planning that is available and how San Francisco is participating in regional planning issues.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>- He agrees with both points that Commission Feldstein commented on.</p>

        <p>- He would like to have his correspondence sent to his dental office.</p>

        <p>- He also agrees to have a joint hearing between the Planning Commission and the Building Inspection Commission.</p>

        <p>- He would like to see the Housing Element as a priority.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Planning and Economic Development Commission</i></p>

        <p>- Supervisor Peskin has proposed a Charter amendment that would consolidate the Building Inspection and Planning Commissions.  The combined commissions would be  called the Planning and Economic Development Commission.</p>

        <p>- He was able to get a draft of this amendment and if anyone would like a copy of it, he would be glad to provide it.</p>

        <p>2) He informed the other Commissioners that he calls staff on Fridays, Mondays and Tuesdays regarding items on the calendar and suggested that they might do the same.</p>

        <p>- It is helpful to try to talk to staff on Fridays because that is when the calendar goes out.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- Informed the public and staff that her computer broke down about 10 days ago so she is backed up on reading and responding to email messages.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

        <p>- There is a tremendous volume of work and paper including emails and phone calls related to items that are on the calendar.  If he does not respond immediately, he asks the public for their understanding and patience.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>8. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's comment:</i></p>

        <p>1) Regional Planning is a good subject matter to discuss. He sits on the ABAG Regional Planning Commission so it would be appropriate to ask ABAG to come and discuss the program they have now.  However, given your calendars, it will be complicated to schedule this subject matter as well as the other items that need to be heard.  But in the next month he will bring information on a date and a possible agenda.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

        <p>2) At the next hearing on June 5, 2003, the Housing Element will be on the agenda.  The public will be able to speak on this item.  Amit Ghosh has been doing outreach efforts in various communities.  This hearing will be televised but it will not be held in the Board's chambers.</p>

        <p><i>Re: Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>3) The public was able to speak on the Eastern Neighborhoods at a hearing held in March.  The intent was to receive information on options and receive input from Commissioners.  He did express that it was his desire to hold another hearing at least a month or so after that date.  Since this has yet happened, it is important to at least give a status report: (If the commission requires more information and input, then something can be calendared).</p>

          <ul><p>&#183; Since that time, staff has been meeting with community groups to get their feedback.</p>

          <p>&#183; Staff has been spending time with other agencies (Small Business Advisory Commission, Redevelopment Agency, etc.) to receive their input.</p>

          <p>&#183; We have been trying to clarify how funding will be obtained for the environmental review.  This is even more difficult because of our budget constraints.  He believes that the Mayor's office and others see the importance of this and he feels there is still a way to fund this.  Because of anticipated budget hearings, June will not be a good month to have a hearing on this.  He suggests that we try to schedule an additional hearing in July.</p>

          <p>&#183; The biggest issue right now is getting feedback from the public.  That is what staff is currently doing.</p>

        </ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

        <p>- There are no notice requirements and no controls in industrial areas.  There should be more controls.</p>

        <p>- Interim controls expire on July 5, 2003.  The areas that have never been rezoned are the most contentious and the most vulnerable.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>9. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  2690 Harrison Street</i></p>

        <p>- This began in 2001 and the Conditional Use was passed by the Planning Commission on March 20, 2003.  The Conditional Use was appealed to the Board of Supervisors by MAC (Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition).  As he reported last week, the appeal hearing lasted about four hours and there were speakers by both sides.  </p>

        <p>- There were comments made that soured the atmosphere and have taken the issue away from the merits of the actual project.</p>

        <p>- The hearing was continued for 1 week because Supervisor Amiano was not able to be present and the project is located in his district.  The item was continued from May 20, 2003 and Supervisor Amiano suggested the item be continue for two weeks until June 10, 2003, which is the next Board meeting.  It was his wish that there be some time for mediation between the project sponsor and the appellants to this project and he suggested that a member of the Planning Commission be the mediator.  The vote was +8-3 to continue the item to June 10, 2003.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- She asked the City Attorney to clarify how a member of the Planning Commission could be a mediator, and what the Commission needs to be concerned about.</p>

        <p>- She is concerned that if a member of the Planning Commission decides to be a mediator and if for some reason this case comes back to the Commission, the commissioner who mediated could not participate in any action related to the case.  She would like for all the members of the Planning Commission to feel comfortable to make any future decisions on the case.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Deputy City Attorney, Susan Cleveland-Knowles:</font></p>

        <p>- A Commissioner acting independently could act as a mediator.  The person would be acting as an individual and not as a member of the Planning Commission and not acting on behalf of the City and County of San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- None of the members of the Planning Commission are obligated to do so.</p>

        <p>- If someone does decide to take on this role, this person should be aware that if this case comes back to the Planning Commission, their role as a mediator may affect their ability to participate in any future decisions.  It doesn't necessarily, but it may.</p>

        <p>- She was not able to confirm exactly the liability but the person would be acting independently as an individual.</p>

        <p>BOA </p>

        <p><i>Re:  2816 Diamond (Glen Park Market Place)</i></p>

        <p>- A request for re-hearing was denied +5-0 so this is the last time this project will be heard until the building permit is issued.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Residential Demolition Policy</i></p>

        <p>- This was heard by the Planning Commission on May 8, 2003.</p>

        <p>- Both Commissioners Schumacker and Chin questioned and were concerned about the difference between alteration and demolition.  </p>

        <p>- Commissioner Schumakcer is concerned about the number of Discretionary Reviews before the Planning Commission.  He felt that the Planning Commission should only be looking at losses of 4 units or more.  The Zoning Administrator (ZA) mentioned that the public [Commission] was concerned about the loss of single-family houses in RH-2 districts.  Commissioner Schumacker understood this.</p>

        <p>- Commissioner Harrington was concerned about how the Planning Commission weighed existing buildings that are small vs. the need for family housing.  The ZA mentioned that cases are looked at on a case-by-case basis.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>10.                                                                           (PUTRA/WILSON: (415) 558-6233)</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>RESIDENTIAL DESIGN GUIDELINES</u> - Introduction of and  informational presentation on the updated and expanded Residential Design Guidelines (Guidelines) for all residential projects in RH (Residential House) and RM (Residential Mixed-Density) zoning districts.  This hearing is for the purpose of officially announcing the release of a draft, and future hearing date. The public may express comments. No action is required by the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may adopt the Guidelines at a future public hearing.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Supervisor Dufty</font></p>

        <p>- He is grateful that these guidelines are before the Planning Commission.</p>

        <p>- This will kick off a public process that is very important for the City and for Planning purposes.</p>

        <p>- He has offered a supplemental measure to try and provide some supplemental resources that will enable the Planning Department to move forward with better Neighborhoods and to complete the Eastern Neighborhoods studies and to hopefully finalize these Residential Design Guidelines that are so important.</p>

        <p>- The Planning Department should not be criticized for not completing projects if they are not funded.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Sue Hestor</font></p>

        <p>- This is terrific.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Section 311 hearing which is the McGoldrick legislation on major alterations, the hearing on demolitions, and the hearing on adopting these guidelines will result in a real process to resolve cases internally with staff.</p>

        <p>- She is not saying that the Discretionary Review process should be abolished--it just should not be routine.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) John Schlesinger</font></p>

        <p>- His concerns about this document are:  1) there seems to be a shift of focus and a loss of the big picture; and 2) the document does not take into account privacy and the actual use of rooms in a building. </p>

        <p>- There seems to be limited focus on an item and then loosing the true focus about what this document should really be.</p>

        <p>- This document will increase Discretionary Reviews and it will be more difficult to review cases.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Shawn Gorman</font></p>

        <p>- He is an architect and has been working with the Residential Design Guidelines since 1989 when they were released.</p>

        <p>- It is very important to keep in mind that staff has been applying these guidelines for about 12 years now making the process very prescriptive.</p>

        <p>- Some of the concerns he has is that this document will bring more prescriptive solutions instead of more creative solutions.</p>

        <p>- There should not be &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; solutions.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bridget Maley - ARG</font></p>

        <p>- She works in the field of historic preservation.</p>

        <p>- One of her daily tasks is to work with cities throughout California on the issues of neighborhood character.</p>

        <p>- Staff has done a wonderful job with this document and she asks that the Commission update the guidelines this summer.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Jeanene Przyblyski - Friends of Noe Valley, Collingwood Hill</font></p>

        <p>- These groups have a great interest in these guidelines.</p>

        <p>- She spends hours every week with people who are not happy about their neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- She was very happy when Supervisor Dufty asked her to arrange a meeting with Mr. Green and Mr. Badiner and have them give an overview of these revised guidelines and how they might help them work through the process of understanding development in her neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- She has not had much time to review them but she will be providing her input to staff.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Ross Levy - Levy Art &amp; Architecture</font></p>

        <p>- He is concerned that this document is [promoting] anti-contemporary design.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about this and feels this City should encourage diverse expressions.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) F. Joseph Butler, AIA</font></p>

        <p>- His issues relate to height and bulk and the provision of natural light and exposure from newly remodeled or proposed buildings to those which already exist in a neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- The way to eliminate or reduce the number of Discretionary Reviews is to be firm in applying the guidelines.  It is not what is in the guidelines it is how consistently they are enforced.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Mary Anne Miller</font></p>

        <p>- In 1979 the first version of these guidelines were started.</p>

        <p>- Homes in the Sunset District have been changing a lot.</p>

        <p>- These guidelines have been improved since 1979.</p>

        <p>- The problem is that planners should be very well instructed in these guidelines.</p>

        <p>- Green buildings are important also.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Jonathan Pearlman</font></p>

        <p>- He emphasized the word guidelines because that is what they should be.</p>

        <p>- He thinks that the only problem with these guidelines is that they are anti-modern and based solely on a past environment.</p>

        <p>- Neighborhoods change and have to grow.</p>

        <p>- He encourages the Commission to look at these like guidelines and not prescriptions.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Arnie Lerner - Lerner and Associates Architects</font></p>

        <p>- He is concerned about legislating design.</p>

        <p>- He is also concerned about how people determine the scale of a building.  He does not believe there is enough emphasis devoted to this principal.</p>

        <p>- This is a golden opportunity to introduce to the public the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation since they are the guidelines for historic buildings and historic districts.</p>

        <p>- It would be a good idea to put successful projects on the Planning Department's website.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Daniela Kirshenbaum - Pacific Heights Residents Association</font></p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission adopts these basics of good planning and use them as a lens through which to view the decisions the Commission makes.</p>

        <p>- The challenge will be to apply these guidelines consistently.  It will be the consistency of their use that will help reduce Discretionary Views.</p>

        <p>- This type of good work should be on television and she hopes that the Commission hearings will again be broadcasted soon.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) J.P. Harbour - Pacific Heights Residents Association</font></p>

        <p>- He is in support of these guidelines.</p>

        <p>- They play a really strong role in guiding the prudent and intelligent design of every neighborhood in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- Protecting historic structures is equally important as constructing new buildings.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Alice Barkley</font></p>

        <p>- She feels that these guidelines are so restrictive that they will increase Discretionary Reviews instead of decrease them.</p>

        <p>- One cannot look at a City just by the street or by the buildings next to a proposed construction.</p>

        <p>- It is a shame to not allow future architects to practice in this City.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Kirk Scott</font></p>

        <p>- He cannot underscore the importance of putting prescriptive illustrations on the guidelines.</p>

        <p>- It is important to emphasize why private views are not protected.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Courtney Clarkson - Pacific Heights Residents Association</font></p>

        <p>- She supports the design guidelines, but the big problem is that the individual planners do not always adhere to the design guidelines.</p>

        <p>- She is constantly dealing with the same planners and she is constantly complaining about the same things.</p>

        <p>- She urges the department to have some continuity.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community</font></p>

        <p>- The guidelines are a very good start but it needs to go further.</p>

        <p>- More information is needed regarding building scale, depth, rear yards, etc. especially in RH-2 neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- The issues before the Commission are the second most important issues in this City and it is important that the public be informed by televising the Planning Commission hearings.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

        <p>- There are neighborhoods that need to be preserved.</p>

        <p>- The guidelines are just guides.  </p>

        <p>- As Commissioners, you will still have to listen to Discretionary Review protests and have long hearings because of the topography and nature of this city.</p>

        <p>- There is no way to legislate what is going to be in the future.</p>

        <p>- The building codes are creating reductions. </p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Judy Berkowitz - EMIA and CSFN</font></p>

        <p>- She referenced Page 57, item 8 -- special guidelines for historical and architecturally significant buildings.</p>

        <p>- It is important to have enforcement, and planners have a lot of responsibility for this.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Tom McDonough</font></p>

        <p>- Cities are about density.</p>

        <p>- Larger buildings should be built along transit corridors.</p>

        <p>- Dynamic neighborhoods should be creatively designed with families in mind.</p>

        <p>- The City could be much more children friendly.</p>

The proposed project consists of  two elements: the first is two ordinances introduced by the Board of Supervisors amending the San Francisco Planning Code (including Zoning Maps 8 and 8SU) to change the zoning on the block bounded by Rhode Island, 17th, Kansas and Mariposa Streets from M-1 (Light Industrial) to NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial).  The proposed legislation would also add Section 781.10, which would create a 17th and Rhode Island Street Grocery Store Special Use Subdistrict applicable to the block described above to permit a neighborhood grocery store with beer and wine sales on that block.  The second element is a proposed development that would involve the construction of a five-story building ranging in height from 16 &#189; feet to 52 &#189; feet and containing about 204,800 square feet of mixed-use residential/retail space.  The project would include approximately 168 residential units, approximately 4,000 square feet of retail space, and approximately 34,500 square feet of grocery store space.  In addition, a parking garage would partially occupy three levels, providing a total of approximately 323 self-park off-street parking spaces.  The new proposed building would step-up the north slope of the Potrero Hill project site (Assessor's Block 3978, Lot 1), which is bounded by 17<sup>th</sup> Street on the north, Rhode Island Street on the east, Mariposa Street on the south, and Kansas Street on the west.  The project site is within the M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 40-X height/bulk district.  </p>

The proposed project involves the replacement/modernization of a gasoline station and construction of an AM/PM mini-mart, demolition of an existing Smog Pro building, removal and replacement of underground petroleum storage tanks (USTs), and partial site re-grading.  The 1,680-gross-square-foot (gsf) project building would result in an approximately 50-gsf expansion of the 24-hour commercial operation.  The project would retain the two Mission Street access points, eliminate a Huron Street access, eliminate a Sickles Avenue access near Mission Street, and retain the Sickles Avenue access closest to Huron Street.

        <p>- ARCO submitted many letters from the neighborhood and neighborhood associations.</p>

        <p>- This site was built in 1970.</p>

        <p>- The project will eliminate a lot of confusion from people trying to enter from too many driveways.</p>

        <p>- There will be pass-through traffic in three pump locations, there will be easier fueling positions, and the tanks will be completely replaced.</p>

        <p>- The retaining wall will be more of a stucco type wall to match the aesthetics of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- He is the area Real Estate Manager.</p>

        <p>- All of the facilities in the Bay Area are more than 30 years old.</p>

        <p>- In most cases where there are larger lots, they include a car wash or other amenities.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that this project will be something that the community will be proud of.</p>

        <p>- If there is a maintained 24-hour facility, there is more control than if there is a facility that closes--which can give people the opportunity to sleep there and engage in other negative activities.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gina Haney - Outer Mission Residents Association</font></p>

        <p>- She does not want to have the facility open 24 hours nor to sell beer and wine.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sharon Eberhardt - Cayuga Neighborhood Association</font></p>

        <p>- It only makes good business sense to contact the neighborhood association either via a telephone call or a letter.  Her association was not notified of this project.</p>

        <p>- He did speak with representatives of Tait and Associates several times.  He just wanted to clear that matter.</p>

        <p>- They have gathered about 750 petitions against this project.</p>

        <p>- His organization has been dealing with land use issues for a long time; this is the first time a project sponsor has not been in dialogue with his association dealing with neighborhood issues.  This makes a statement since it means that the project sponsor will not be a good neighbor.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Raymond Rivera</font></p>

        <p>- It is impossible for ARCO to say that they are not making any money since there is a tanker delivering gas every single day.  With the price of gas right now, they should be making a profit.</p>

        <p>- His mother in-law's backyard is right next to the gas station and she has had many problems with this station.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Officer Anna Brown - Ingleside Police Station</font></p>

        <p>- A lot of the testimonies from the residents are quality of life issues and these do not get reported.</p>

        <p>- The police are concerned about a gas station that has a mini mart that sells beer and wine and they do not want to support this.</p>

        <p>- They have to listen to what the community wants.</p>

        <p>- There is a Walgreen's about four blocks away, a Safeway about eight blocks away, and an Albertson's about one mile away.</p>

        <p>- ARCO has not been a good project sponsor because they have not communicated with the neighbors.</p>

        <p>- ARCO will be able to get a profit even if they do not sell alcohol.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Andrew Zacks - Attorney for Appellant (Citizens for Better Streets)</font></p>

        <p>- There are several reasons why this item should be continued.  One is the pending litigation against the City and County of San Francisco over the right of the City and County of San Francisco to transfer this property to the developer.  The matter which is currently pending in court may well result in a determination that the City and County of San Francisco does not have the right to enter into a lease agreement that has been proposed by way of a resolution adopted by the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p>- This litigation involves a claim under the California Streets and Highway Code that the lease, which calls for a 50 year lease at ten thousand dollars a year to the developer, violates the Streets and Highway Code.</p>

        <p>- The developer who has filed an environmental evaluation application and a conditional use application does not have standing under the provisions of the City Planning Code to seek such permits since only an owner has the right and power to file for a conditional use application.  It is clear that CCDC (the developer of this case) is not an owner of the property nor have they been authorized by the existing owners (the City and County of San Francisco) to file a permit application.</p>

        <p>- If this matter is not continued, the Planning Commission is continuing in a matter where there is no jurisdiction.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(did not state name) - representing Jerlanni, Inc.</font></p>

        <p>- He supports the request for a continuance.</p>

        <p>- It is clear that the Mayor's Office of Housing does not have jurisdiction over this parcel.  The jurisdiction is under the Department of Public Works.  MOH does not have authorization to give to the developer.</p>

        <p>- The Deputy City Attorney is not the appropriate person to give advice to the Commission and he objects to her participation in this matter since she is representing the MOH in litigation.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">The Zoning Administrator responded:</font></p>

        <p><i>- This item is in court.  There is litigation about whether the transfer is proper however the City prevailed on a request for a temporary restraining order.  There was no temporary restraining order.  From consultations with the City Attorney, the department believes that it is appropriate and that the hearing should go ahead.  The economic issues on whether it was an appropriate transfer under the State Traffic Code is not before the Commission.  What is before the Commission is the project.  The question about the economic issues and the amount of the lease is not before the Commission either.  What is before the Commission is if the environmental impact is adequate, the general plan issues, historic district issues and the conditional use.</i></p>



        <p><i>- He submitted a letter of authorization from the Mayor's Office of Housing to the project sponsor who filed the Conditional Use and it includes the Real Estate Division authorizing the Chinatown Community Development Center to apply for a Conditional Use.  He consulted with the City Attorney on these issues.</i></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">The City Attorney responded (Audrey Pearson):</font></p>

        <p><i>- What is before the Commission is an appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration.  The litigation and the Negative Declaration have nothing to do with each other.</i></p>

        <p><i>- The Commission is able to go forward on this project.</i></p>

        <p>- There are other projects that have parking issues.  There was no specific parking study for this particular project.</p>

        <p>- They are concerned about the size of the building because it will block light and air.  There is no evaluation on this in the negative declaration.</p>

        <p>- The transportation assessment relied on a report that was done for the Embarcadero/Broadway hotel project that he suggests creates a cumulative impact.</p>

        <p>- At a minimum, there should have been a parking study.</p>

        <p>- There will also be an increase in noise, but the negative declaration does not state that.</p>

        <p>between Battery and Front Streets; Lot 011 in Assessors Block 0141 - The proposal is to construct a new mid-rise building that will contain 87 units of affordable housing with retail, childcare, and community spaces, built over an underground parking level accessed from Front Street and containing up to 41 off-street spaces. This project is proposed for land that is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works (DPW) and is partially leased to a parking vendor.  The Board of Supervisors previously approved in principle the transfer of the property from DPW to the Mayor's Office of Housing for the development of affordable housing.  A General Plan Referral is needed at this time in order for the Board of Supervisors to consider (a) lease disposition and development agreement that will allow the affordable housing developer, Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC), to move forward with development activities, and (b) a future ground lease between the City and Chinatown CDC to be entered into at the start of construction.  The subject property is zoned C-2 (Community Business), is in the Northern Waterfront S.U.D. No. 3, and in a 84-E Height and Bulk District.  </p>

        <p>- This project will be very important for San Francisco, especially for working families.</p>

        <p>- Two thirds of the units will house families earning up to $46,000 a year.  This means teachers, nurses, hotel and restaurant workers, etc.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Flor Ramos</font></p>

        <p>- She is a community worker.</p>

        <p>- She works with the immigrant community.  One of the main problems immigrants have are affordable housing and high rents.</p>

        <p>- Please take immigrant people into account as this project is considered.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Kate White - Housing Action Coalition</font></p>

        <p>- There are very few opportunities to build housing that people really need.</p>

        <p>- This parcel provides a unique opportunity for low-income housing.</p>

        <p>- Mixed income neighborhoods are good locations.</p>

        <p>- Chinatown Community Neighborhood Association is a wonderful manager for affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- Gerson Baker and Associates is one of the many organizations who support this project.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this project.</p>

        <p>He urges the Commission to approve this project since it is desirable and necessary to the neighborhood.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Paul Utrecht - Giudani, Inc.</font></p>

        <p>- The exceptions that this project is asking for are not justified by it's affordable housing character.</p>

        <p>- Affordable housing is not bad, it's just that affordable housing should play by the rules that everyone else plays by.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor wants to get things that directly affect the neighbors.  Things like a rear yard variance and an exception from the parking requirements.</p>

        <p>- Assuming that the residents will not have cars is a very serious assumption.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joel Lipsky - Housing Development Director - Mayor's Office of Housing</font></p>

        <p>- He is here to respond if there are any questions regarding any issues related to the Mayor's Office of Housing.</p>

        <p>- This has been going on for a couple of years.  They were at the Board of Permit Appeals and that Board suggested they obtain a mediator.  The community and the project sponsors went to a mediator.  They made a great deal of progress yet there were still issues to deal with.</p>

        <p>- The Boosters have worked well with clubs in the neighborhood to ensure friendly neighborhood operations.  This has not worked well with the lounge.</p>

        <p>- They do not want to limit the business of the lounge yet they are only discussing the hours of operation.</p>

        <p>- He admitted that in his first year of operation he made many mistakes.</p>

        <p>- He had never been cited or warned by the Police.  He never received a letter or email from any neighbor and he never heard from the Potrero Boosters.</p>

        <p>- He has initiated and participated in the mediation.  He gave his cell phone and email to the immediate neighbors.</p>

        <p>- He put a new sound system that meets Police noise abatement requirements.  He installed air conditioning and has permanently closed all movable windows in the closed position.  He installed a sound-proof curtain on the front door and has put up signs asking patrons to respect the neighbors.  He has installed outdoor lighting, changed his recycling schedule, and hired new security.</p>

        <p>- The one point he is still concerned about is the schedule.  Ceasing all entertainment at 10:00 p.m. will kill his business.  He needs to be granted the hours he originally requested in order for his business to progress.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve the hours of operation he requested.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jerrod Howard</font></p>

        <p>- He is the new head of security at the lounge.</p>

        <p>- He has worked at a lot of nightclubs in the bay area and this is the most calm place he has worked as a bouncer.  He has been offered other higher-paying jobs but he has turned them down.</p>

        <p>- He is surprised at how many people are at the lounge that live in the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- At about 12:00 a.m. or 1:00 a.m. there is not that many people there.</p>
