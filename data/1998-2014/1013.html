        <p><i>Re:  Continuance</i></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Marilyn Amini</font></p>

        <p>- She feels that there was not adequate notice on this item.</p>

        <p>- It has been said that there were notices in the public libraries, yet the library near her home has been closed.  Apparently it is posted on the internet, but she does not have a computer.  It was also published in the Saturday Independent, but the print is really small and she did not receive it.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Steven Linder</font></p>

        <p>- He also did not know about these proposed changes.  He found out about it from the previous speaker.</p>

        <p>- He feels that there was not adequate notice for the public to come and speak about this proposed change.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Housing Element </i></p>

        <p>Larry Badiner, Zoning Administrator, responded:</p>

        <p>- There is a lot of confusion on what staff is asking the Commission.</p>

        <p>- The only question that staff has before the Commission is if the Department should advertise for a hearing.  This is called an initiation.</p>

        <p>- The Director will clarify a few things when this item is called.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>6. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p>John Paul Samaha gave a presentation on the Board of Supervisor's item:</p>

        <p><i>The following items were passed out of the Land Use Committee by a unanimous vote:</i></p>

        <p>1) Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District</p>

        <p>2) Designation of the Dogpatch Historic District</p>

        <p>3) Zoning Map Amendment - King and Townsend Streets (601 King Street)</p>

        <p><i>Matters at the Full Board:</i></p>

        <p><i>Re:  1193 Oak Street - Appeal of a Conditional Use</i></p>

        <p>- This was an authorization to allow a master tenant to run a bed and breakfast out of her dwelling unit.</p>

        <p>- A member of the Board announced that they had received new information about this matter and the item was continued for one week.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  40-50 Lansing Street - Appeal of a Negative Declaration</i></p>

        <p>- Appeal was continued for two weeks and will be heard again as a 3:00 p.m. Special Order before the Board of Supervisors on April 8, 2003.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Zoning Map Change</i></p>

        <p>- The Full Board sent this back to the Land Use Committee because of a technicality.</p>

        <p>- Apparently the Negative Declaration document was not circulated to every member of the Board.</p>

        <p><i>The Board passed the following legislation on second and final reading:</i></p>

        <p>1) Conditional Use Revocations legislation</p>

        <p>2) Designation of 1338 Filbert Street Cottages as a Landmark </p>

        <p>3) 1250 Haight Street - Special Use District to create Haight Street senior affordable housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Note:</font>  The Land Use Committee will not meet this coming Monday, March 31.   Besides the 1193 Oak Street Conditional Use Appeal, no significant Planning items will be considered by the Full Board at its Tuesday, April 1, meeting.</p>

        <p>- As a musician he was very excited to find a venue that is more &quot;grass roots&quot; than commercial.</p>

        <p>- He supports this project completely.</p>

        <p><u>HOUSING ELEMENT UPDATE - FINAL DRAFT FOR PUBLIC REVIEW</u>  -  Staff presentation of Housing Element Final Draft for Public Review released February 10, 2003.  The Planning Commission will also consider a resolution of intention to adopt proposed amendments to the General Plan.  The resolution of intention only enables the publication of a formal notice for a public hearing.  It is at that future hearing that the Planning Commission would consider the proposed amendments to the General Plan under the provisions of Sections 340 and 306.3(b)(3) of the Planning Code.  Proposed revisions will update the Residence Element adopted in 1990 and include an assessment of housing needs, new policies to increase housing production such as higher residential densities along appropriate transit corridors and downtown neighborhoods; encouragement of housing development in neighborhood commercial districts; reconsideration of residential parking requirements; and policies supporting construction of new family housing.  The Final Draft for Public Review incorporated modifications based on comments and other feedback received by the Planning Department in the first draft.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Daryl Higashi - Director of the Mayors Office of Housing</font></p>

        <p>- San Francisco is far behind in having a housing element accepted by the State of California.</p>

        <p>- There are funding programs that organizations will be able to apply for with this measure.</p>

        <p>- If there is no adopted plan approved by the Commission and or approved by the Board of Supervisors, San Francisco will not be able to apply for housing funds from the State.</p>

        <p>- This opportunity should not be missed.</p>

        <p>- He is in support of this plan.</p>

        <p>- Supporting this plan allows for market rate housing.</p>

        <p>- He hopes the Commission will continue to work with staff to move along this initiation.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Olson Lee - Assistant Deputy Director of the Office of Housing at the Redevelopment Agency</font></p>

        <p>- The agency's housing plan is incorporated with the City's annual housing plan also.</p>

        <p>- There is a need for more affordable housing as well as a need to save and preserve affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- Housing is difficult but it is more cost effective to save affordable housing than to build fresh.</p>

        <p>- There is a need for a compliant housing element.</p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission and staff to do whatever can be done to expedite the process and allow for the appropriate public comment on the housing element.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Steven Linder</font></p>

        <p>- The housing element encourages secondary units near transit and this increases crime.</p>

        <p>- Families with children are a protected class under California law and they have certain needs.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joya Calagos - SFOP</font></p>

        <p>- They believe that San Francisco should be a City for all.</p>

        <p>- City policy should promote families and communities.</p>

        <p>- Each person has the right to have his or her space, which means affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- If affordable housing is not supplied, children will not be able to afford (a place) to live and will eventually need to move out of the City.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Oscar Herrera - SFOP</font></p>

        <p>- He feels that there is a lack of affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- This policy is very important.  The decisions that the Commission makes will affect the children of this City and their future.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Tracy Parent</font></p>

        <p>- She is a real estate agent who works with immigrants.</p>

        <p>- She urges the Commission to expedite this policy.</p>

        <p>- Her one concern is that the implementation of the plan should be more explicit.</p>

        <p>- If the density bonus would be leveraged, the City would save millions of dollars and this would allow for focus on building affordable housing for the most in need--Seniors.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Michael Harris - San Francisco Rev. Com.</font></p>

        <p>- He has concerns about the draft housing element and the oversight of income to affordable housing and jobs for low-income residents.</p>

        <p>-  The date and needs analysis section does not address the key relationship between jobs for existing residents that result from approved projects of this Commission.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Susie Wong - Chinese Community Development Corporation</font></p>

        <p>- She suggested having a senior staff person be in charge of the implementation of this policy.  That person could also be a liaison with the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p>- She also requested a tracking system.</p>

        <p>- Fund and produce an annual publication that would have a summary of the reports issued by the proposed Housing Element Implementation Officer.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Craig Adlemon - Tenderloin Neighborhood Development Corporation</font></p>

        <p>- He thanked staff for the thorough work of this report.</p>

        <p>- He emphasized the importance of affordable rental housing.</p>

        <p>- It is important also to have participation from community organizations.</p>

        <p>- It is easer to buy and rehabilitate buildings for affordable housing than to build new.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Calvin Welch - CCHO</font></p>

        <p>- He recognizes the challenge of the housing element.</p>

        <p>- For housing, the project work force is what is important.</p>

        <p>- The needs assessment is correct in this report.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Danny Burkes - Westwood Park Association</font></p>

        <p>- This housing element that is now under consideration is very important to the future of families in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- The association requests that the housing element be continued for at least 90 days in order to hold public meetings and incorporate public comment on the proposal.</p>

        <p>- This policy should not be approved in its current form.</p>

        <p>- He encourages the Commission to expedite this continuance.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Joe O'Donahue</font></p>

        <p>- The housing element does not address why the delivery system failed and why the housing crisis since 1986 keeps getting worse and worse.</p>

        <p>- The delivery system is a shambles.  There is a disparity between housing costs, housing crisis, and construction.</p>

        <p>- There is a need to get some economists and do some econometrics.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jill Kent</font></p>

        <p>- There is much concern about the housing element.</p>

        <p>- There has not been good notification about this proposal.</p>

        <p>- There has been a petition in the West Portal neighborhood that requests that this housing element not be approved. It should be continued until there is sufficient public comment from the various neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- It is important to explain the pros and the cons.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bernie Choden - SFT</font></p>

        <p>- The draft element does not meet the requirements for this City, and it does not provide the tools needed.</p>

        <p>- There needs to be a melding of institutions and corporations .</p>

        <p>- There needs to be a strategy.</p>

        <p>- An expert needs to be hired before a date is set to provide proper input.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mary Anne Miller</font></p>

        <p>- There is a major demand for housing in her district.</p>

        <p>- SPEAK is in the foot notes as a community group that was consulted on this, but that must have been about a year ago.  They have not been contacted recently.</p>

        <p>- Her organization is willing to help because they are housing friendly.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dan Kalb - SFT</font></p>

        <p>- His comments regarding the proposed document:  1) It is important that developers not get away with just having all the same unit sizes in a given large development; 2) there should be higher density on large transit corridors; 3) financing is the biggest challenge; 4) the increase in housing stock has to be approved and built in proportion and concurrent with improvements in infrastructure and transit services; 5) there should be hearings throughout the City before this document is finally approved; 6) educational programs to inform the values and reality of new housing; 7) he suggest that there be caution about asking for any CEQA exemptions.</p>

        <p>- He supports much of what Mr. Calvin Welch spoke about.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marilyn Amini</font></p>

        <p>- The newspaper wording stated that this hearing was for an intent to adopt and now it has been changed to an intent to initiate.</p>

        <p>- She lives in a transit corridor and many people are concerned about what is happening at transit corridors.</p>

        <p>- She is worried that this is not sufficient notice about something this important.</p>

        <p>- There is faulty data that the needs are based on.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Judith Berkowitz - Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhoods</font></p>

        <p>- She feels that there has not been enough notice for people to give proper comment.</p>

        <p>- It is important to have comments from all neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- She requested that the Commission continue this for at least 90 days.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Francisco Centurion - Russian Hill Neighbors</font></p>

        <p>- He requested that this be continued for at least 60-90 days in order to get sufficient input from his neighborhood.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Pinky Kushner - SPEAK</font></p>

        <p>- The element is too vague.</p>

        <p>- There are various ideas that could be implemented in the element.</p>

        <p>- More time is needed for this element to be successful.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Edward Evans - Community Resources Action Project</font></p>

        <p>- Many seniors and disabled people are in jeopardy of loosing affordable housing.</p>

        <p>- He is very supportive of making permanent subsidized housing for seniors and disabled people.</p>

        <p>- Housing should be provided on all levels.</p>

        <p>- In the tenderloin there has been a focus on low income and subsidized housing.  Market rate housing should be brought there as well.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Eric Quezada - MAC</font></p>

        <p>- He does not know whether to just laugh, cry or through his hands up from frustration.</p>

        <p>- It is important to move this policy forward after receiving the proper input from neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- It is getting very difficult for neighborhoods to believe that there is a process that rally matters.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) John Bardis - Inner Sunset Action Committee</font></p>

        <p>- He is dismayed about the process of today.</p>

        <p>- This should not be a final draft since there has not been a draft in 13 years.</p>

        <p>- There has not been any environmental review.</p>

        <p>- There is a need for public review and it has not been presented to the public yet.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Hiroshi Fukuda - Richmond Community Association</font></p>

        <p>- He is glad that the Director of Planning has mentioned that there will be future neighborhood input because this is a very important policy matter.</p>

        <p>- The citizens need to read this.  Copies should have been provided at all public libraries and the Supervisors should have copies to provide to the residents of their districts.</p>

        <p>- A document that is this important needs a lot of public comment.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Cris Durazo - SOMCAN</font></p>

        <p>- She is glad that there will future public comment.</p>

        <p>- The environmental impact report should be parallel to this proposal.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Margaret Brodkin</font></p>

        <p>- She feels that the City is &quot;hemorrhaging&quot; families and the reason is housing.</p>

        <p>- She is glad that most of their ideas were incorporated in the plan.</p>

        <p>- The challenge now is how to make it happen.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Nahla Awad</font></p>

        <p>- She read a letter from a member of San Francisco Merchants Association who requested that this item be continued in order to receive more public comment.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor</font></p>

        <p>- This document is contradictory to the policy of the Planning Department since the Department approves a housing project just to have housing.</p>

        <p>- The income levels need to be looked at.</p>

        <p>- Demolition policy also needs to be looked at closely.</p>

        <p>- The most affordable housing is what should be analyzed.</p>

        <p>- Any housing does not equal housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Tom McDonaugh</font></p>

        <p>- Housing is a basic human need.</p>

        <p>- Only one third of the people living in San Francisco own their own housing.</p>

        <p>- San Francisco needs to make sure that the inhabitants of the City are home owners--this is a long time benefit to this City.</p>

        <p>- Part of the backbone of the City was excluded from home ownership.</p>

        <p>- housing is so expensive because it is highly controlled.  That is why it (prices) continues to escalate.</p>

        <p>ACTION: The Planning Commission, pursuant to Planning Code Section 340, initiates an update and amendment of the Housing Element of the General Plan of the City and County of San Francisco.  The consideration of the proposed amendments for adoption will occur at a duly noticed hearing on May 1, 2003.  </p>
