 Item 7 - 2844-2846 Greenwich Street - There was a fax that was sent
 to the commissioners about his firm being retained to represent Mr.
 Somaya.   The Commission had no jurisdiction to take DR in this matter
 because the 30 day period described in Section 311 had expired by
 at least 60 days at the time the DR request was filed.  Mr. Somaya
 had a reasonable belief that his project would no longer be subject
 to DR, yet the Commission granted DR.  At the April 13, 2000 meeting,
 there was a finding of intent to make a dicision. Mr. Kowakami believes
 that this is a legal issue that should be taken up by the City Attorney</font><font size=2 color=#000000 face="Arial, Times New Roman">&#146;s

 would be willing to drop the penthouse structure and just continue

 as a conditional use authorization as compatible and desirable to
 the neighbrohood.   The Commision passed a vote of +4 -3.  The lead
 planner on the case had come to the opposite conclusion that was
 given to the Commision at the time of the hearing and that information
 was not given to the Commissioners.   The lead planner recommended
 denial based on inappropriate scale for the district.  The planner
 and the neighbors were in agreement.  What other information is being
