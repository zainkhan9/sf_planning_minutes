<p><font class="heading2">A. CONSIDERATION OF ITEMS PROPOSED FOR CONTINUANCE</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>The Commission will consider a request for continuance to a later date.  The Commission may choose to continue the item to the date proposed below, to continue the item to another date, or to hear the item on this calendar.</p>

    <p>1. 2002.0914R (D. ARGUMEDO: (415) 558-6308/S. SHOTLAND: (415) 558-6284)</p>

      <ul><p><u>675 TOWNSEND STREET.</u>  south side between 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup> Streets;  Lot 007 in Assessor Block 3799.  The project is related to Planning Case No. 1998.455C, a mixed use development of 148 dwelling units, approximately 35,000 square feet of ground floor commercial space and 256 parking spaces in two basement levels.  Due to the presence of a Caltrain easement, the originally proposed 7'-6&quot; wide sidewalk along Townsend Street would be reduced to 4'-6&quot; to maintain a minimum distance from an existing rail line in the Townsend Street right-of-way.  The reduced sidewalk width is less than the Department of Public Works' minimum 6-foot sidewalk width standard.  The subject property (675 Townsend Street) is in an M-2 (Heavy Industrial) District and a 40-X/50-X (Height and Bulk) District.</p>

    </ul><p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Find the proposal not in conformity with the General Plan</p>

The California Building Code no longer allows fire escapes as a second means of egress in most cases. This proposed text amendment provides an exemption to meet the requirements of the Building Code.

      <p><i>Re:  Resignation as Commissioner</i></p>

      <p>- Announced that effective at the close of the hearing on the Transbay Terminal today she will be resigning from the San Francisco Planning Commission.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's Resignation</i></p>

      <p>- She stated that the Commission has been very fortunate.  Many people thought there would be fireworks as a result of a Commission chosen by the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor.</p>

      <p>- It has been a pleasure for her to work with Commissioner Feldstein.  She has brought organization and fairness to the Commission.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's Resignation</i></p>

      <p>- He is thankful to have worked with Commissioner Feldstein.  All of her decisions have been totally prepared and supported with findings.</p>

      <p>- He wished her luck in her future endeavors.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Rental Market</i></p>

      <p>- He read an article regarding the softness in the rental market.</p>

      <p>- The lesson here is that the Commission has to base their findings in regards to policies on what is the present state of affairs and not what used to be the state of affairs.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's Resignation</i></p>

      <p>- Assertive and Aggressive - these words combined describe Commissioner Feldstein's professionalism towards the Commission.</p>

      <p>- There was a perception that the Commission would not go beyond deadlock, this has not been the case at all.</p>

      <p>- He wished her blessings.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner William Lee:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's Resignation</i></p>

      <p>- He thanked Commissioner Feldstein for bringing the Commission to another dimension.</p>

      <p>- Although they voted differently on various items, he respects her very much.</p>

      <p>- He knows that her daughter will be a developer in the future.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein's Resignation:</i></p>

      <p>- He will miss Commissioner Feldstein and is sorry to see her go.</p>

      <p>- As Commissioners, it is their job to contribute their time and background to the City of San Francisco.  Commissioner Feldstein has risen above what the average Commissioner should bring.</p>

      <p>- He wished her luck in future endeavors and hopes to work with her again.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

      <p>Re:  Home Depot EIR project and Commissioners appointments on the Eastern Neighborhoods project.</p>

      <p>- She wants to know what the status is on these.</p>

        <ul><p><font class="heading2">Acting Director Badiner responded:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Home Depot</i></p>

        <p>- It is his understanding that as of two weeks or so ago staff was waiting for comments and revisions from the project sponsor.</p>

        <p>- He will find out about these responses and will communicate them to Commissioners via email next week and to the public at the next meeting.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- This just started to move ahead this week because staff misunderstood that he wanted to be in every meeting.  They were trying to accommodate his schedule.</p>

        <p>- Staff should now have started setting up meetings, with or without him being available.</p>

      <p>- The dinner was a success.  It was the first time that it was sold out.</p>

      <p>- There was a wide range of people in attendance.</p>

      <p>- The dinner also raised a lot of money-not yet aware of the amount .</p>

      <p>- These items will be re-examined.  The policies vs. controls in the Mission; and the specific boundaries in the SOMA and what was included and excluded.  SOMA will be scheduled for the May 6, 2004 hearing.  The Mission will be scheduled for June 3, 2004.</p>

The proposal is to adjust the property line between Lots 003 and 004 so that the existing six-unit apartment building (located to the east) is entirely contained on Lot 003 and to allow the construction of a new three-story, single-family residence on Lot 004.</p>

      <p>- What would be the result of heavy construction in the area?</p>

      <p>- There will be a lot of discomfort to the residents of the building.</p>

The proposed building measures 122 feet long and 70 feet deep, a rear yard Variance is requested.  A five-foot rear yard is proposed along the western portion of the lot where an 18.75-foot rear yard is required.  A Variance from the exposure requirements is also requested.  Eight units along the west side of the proposed building would not meet the dwelling unit exposure requirement, which requires all dwelling units to face onto either a street or Code-complying rear yard.

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. </p>

    <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>

    <p>(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or</p>

    <p>(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or </p>

    <p>(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Large Scale Retail Use</i></p>

    <p>- She submitted information related to large scale retail use.</p>

    <p>- The draft legislation which was handed out at the Board of Supervisor's hearing last Monday, is a combination of two pieces of legislations from two Supervisors.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission has received information on this.</p>

    <p>- Have the most important elements been combined in this legislation?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alice Barkley</font></p>

    <p><i>Re: Administrative Issue</i></p>

    <p>- Currently it takes more than two months to get an appointment to file a Conditional Use application or a Variance application.</p>

    <p>- At a minimum if a staff is assigned and the project changes, the staff should be allowed to take the application.</p>

    <p>- It is ridiculous to wait for two months.  There has to be a better way.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Feldstein</i></p>

    <p>- She thanked Commissioner Feldstein for her hard work and contribution during this past year.</p>
