        <p>Re: Eastern Neighborhoods</p>

        <p>- There was a request for public information on this project.  </p>

        <p>- Was this information provided?</p>

        <p>- Apparently the request for the information was met after the deadline of October 20 and all the information was not submitted.</p>

        <p>- She wants to know what the information is that staff believes to be proprietary and cannot be given out to the public.  Can this information be given to Commissioners?</p>

        <p>- She requested the City Attorney present this information next week.</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Larry Badiner responded:</font></p><font class="heading2">

          <p>- He believes that staff has given out as much information as possible.</p>

          <p>- There was some delay while the two different groups of staff coordinated.</p>

          <p>- They did provide the information required when it was asked for.</p>

          <p>- There is some financial information that has been determined proprietary by Dun and Bradstreet.</p>

        <p><i>Re:   Role of Planning Commission</i></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- She just realized that two meetings in November are cancelled and the pending items in December are quite a lot.</p>

        <p>- It is important to manage the calendars more efficiently.  Perhaps adding a December 16 meeting is necessary to take care of cases that have been languishing and have been continued from meeting to meeting. </p>

This proposal would modify previous conditions of approval to allow the payment of an in-lieu fee to the Mayor's Office of Housing rather than provide the 3 required BMR units on-site.
