At this time, the Commission may discuss and take action to set the date of a Special Meeting and/or determine those items that could be placed on the agenda of the next meeting and other future meetings of the Planning Commission.</p><br><br>
<p><b>Commissioner Moore:</b></p>
<p>I attended a press conference held by Chief Gascon in the Northern Station to disclose the Departmentâs moves relative to prostitution and criminal activities in the Mid-Polk neighborhood. The meeting was attended by District Attorney, Kamala Harris, Supervisor Chiu, and the entire senior staff of the Police Department. After I heard the presentation, I felt quite strongly that it would be of advantage to us to have a land use and public safety discussion with some of the commanders in the different districts to have our own decisions relative to land use decisions being more informed. Since many of these decisions come to us in a very fragmented manner I can understand that we donât always have the full set of other arguments. I personally would appreciate that the commissioners agree to schedule such a meeting and really get a more positive discussion about the correlation between land use and public safety. I encourage and ask your support to have such a meeting and put on our Action Item.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>
<p>I too would be very supportive of that because I think there is a nexus between public safety issues and land use decisions and I think we can go a long ways towards helping with that by some of the decisions we make in the future and some of our policies.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Moore:</b></p>
<p>Iâm not finished. I was just looking for support.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>
<p>In relation to your request, my only request would be that we some representatives from citizens groups who represent sex workers or other organizations â that type of thing. I want it to be a balanced discussion where weâre not just getting one perspective but a full community perspective of the issues. </p>
<p><b>Commissioner Moore:</b></p>
<p>We have spent a lot of time in the last three or four weeks preparing for an item on our calendar today which has been continued. Iâd like to bring to whoeverâs attention that the architect set of drawings I was working with was very difficult to read. There is a convention among architects to put the north arrow in the upper side of the page. In this particular set â and I understand why 11 x 17 is a difficult format â this has been turned around and upside down, and with no street names on the perimeter of the block, it is very difficult to understand the set. I ask that this be considered even if the drawings are given to us in a smaller format, I would like to see a consistent depiction of the site and the context in which this project occurs [555 Washington].</p>
<p>The last point Iâd like to make â this was a very positive and upbeat meeting â the other night I wandered into the SPUR lobby just as a meeting was starting and I crashed the meeting. Their meeting was on the interim use of C-3 large vacant parcels, some of which we have identified as being close to eyesores, dilapidation and places of unsafe and unsightly activity. There was a group of young architects (Rebar) whose work youâve seen. They came forward with larger ideas for these large parcels. They will be continuing to discuss this at SPUR and I think it would be exciting to have a presentation. It was a very illuminating discussion.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>
<p>The Director can take this up if he so chooses, but we have had questions from the public about the continuance of 555 Washington Street, which as I understand it we have no control over because Rec and Park has canceled the joint meeting and with their joint meeting, we canât meet.</p>
<p>Also, among the many comments and responses we received in relation to the Candlestick Point Hunters Point Shipyard project, there is a letter from the National Football League supporting it and basically asking that the infrastructure improvements â they are very much in support of those. Iâd like to see if I could get a copy of that earlier than the release to the Response to Comments document. Iâd like to see that.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>
<p>In the Mayorâs Address to the City he mentioned Market Street (Mid-Market). At some point â I made the request at previous hearings about wanting to here some kind of overall sense of what the Planning Department has in mind for that area and maybe you could include the Mayorâs comments. I want to know how they relate to what we discussed in the past.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Sugaya:</b></p>
<p>On that note I have a procedural question: Commissioner Olague just requested something. Do we have to second it six times before it â¦?</p>
<p><b>Director Rahaim:</b></p>
<p>It is helpful for us and I think you have your own policy that more than one commissioner weigh in so that we can be sure that there is consensus that we should work on something.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Sugaya:</b></p>
<p>On that note, I agree with Commissioner Olague and with Commissioner Moore.</p>
<p>I note that in last Fridayâs paper, the School Board has some new rules, one of which is starting meetings on time. Iâd just like to put that into the hopper for 2010.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Miguel:</b></p>
<p>I would like to second Commissioner Mooreâs request and the others that were made. I think we will have time for them and they are areas that come up constantly on individual agenda items to this commission. I think it is better for us if we have overall view of these particular pictures before we start doing it piecemeal, particularly public safety and those types of areas because what happens in one particular neighborhood either overlaps with or pushes out into an adjoining neighborhood. Itâs not just one problem. I think having a better overall view is much better for this commission.</p>
<p>Last Friday I had the pleasure of being a panelist in Berkeley at the Bay Area Social Equity Caucus on SB-375 â the interface between housing and transportation. It was quite interesting; an excellent group of people over there; and I was able to give a little different perspective because of what we have been doing in San Francisco and contrasting that with many representatives from the more suburban and even rural areas. It ended up in a very good discussion. </p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
<h3>D. DIRECTORâS REPORT</h3><br><br>
<p>11. Directorâs Announcements</p><br><br>
<p><b>Director Rahaim:</b></p>
<p>I was going to bring up the continuance of 555 Washington. I want to be clear; the decision to continue was mine. Rec and Park canceled their meeting at my request. It is because there were a number of delays in getting materials to you and to the public and because of some inaccuracies in the reports. For that reason I felt it was important that we move this.</p>
<p>I think I mentioned last week: there are two upcoming public meetings on our Discretionary Review Reform. One is January 27 and the other is February 2<sup>nd</sup>. They are both at the Department at 6 p.m. The public is welcome and commissioners as well.</p>
<p>We are looking at Mid Market at the Mayorâs request. He announced it. We are looking at the previous [Redevelopment] Plan that had been adopted by this commission but was not adopted by the Board [of Supervisors]. We are looking to see how that should change; what the environmental review process needs to be â we are kind of re-scoping it to see what needs to be done to see if we want to bring a new Redevelopment Plan forward or not. We are just in the very early stages right now. Iâm happy to give you a memo in more detail as we scope out what we are doing in the future. The interesting thing about Mid Market is that many of the sites that had been identified in the Redevelopment Plan have entitled projects on them now. So it is a different landscape than it was.</p>
<p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>
<p>I think we actually voted here for a hearing on this subject as a commission. We voted for a hearing where we discuss the vision that the Planning Department and the city has for Market Street including Yerba Buena. It was prompted by ..â¦ Commissioner Moore requested this about a year ago. Weâve all requested to have a more comprehensive look at what the city is thinking in terms of the entire area of Market Street. I donât think a memo would be sufficient. We actually wanted a hearing.</p>
<p><b>Director Rahaim:</b></p>
<p>We will get something organized. Relative to SB-375 and the region, I will be sitting in on a CEO level regional advisory panel that ABAG is organizing with MTC on the implementation of SB-375. We havenât had a meeting yet, but I think the first meeting will be in the first quarter of this year. I will be participating on a regular basis. As we talked about here, I think it is very important for the city to participate in these matters. As youâll see in our budget discussion today, we have allocated some staff time to work on this as well. </p>

<p>13. 2009.1065<u>T</u> (A. Rodgers: (415) 558-6395)</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><u>Development Stimulus and Fee Reform </u>- <b>The Planning Commission will consider three proposed Ordinances introduced by the Mayor as described below. In addition to these three Ordinances the Commission may consider related amendments to the existing City Codes governing planning fees and processes.</b> The three ordinances introduced by the Mayor are:</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b>(a) 091251-2</b> [Development Fee Collection Procedure; Administrative Fee] - This Ordinance would amend the San Francisco Building Code by adding Section 107A.13 to establish a procedure for the Department of Building Inspection (DBI) to collect development impact and in-lieu fees, to provide that the fees are payable prior to issuance of the first building permit or other document authorizing construction of the project, with an option for the project sponsor to defer payment to prior to issuance of the first certificate of occupancy upon agreeing to pay a deferral surcharge on the amount owed that would be deposited into the same fund that receives the development fees, to require that any in-kind public benefits required in-lieu of payment of development fees are implemented prior to issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for the project, to require DBI to generate a Project Development Fee Report prior to issuance of the building or site permit for the project listing all fees due with the opportunity for an appeal of technical errors to the Board of Appeals, to establish a Development Fee Collection Unit within DBI and a fee for administering the program; adopting findings, including environmental findings.</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt">SPEAKERS: Jim Lazarus â SF Chamber of Commerce; David Kriozere â One Rincon Development; Lydia Tan â BRIDGE Housing Corp.; Eastern Neighborhoods Working Group: Fernando Marti, Calvin Welch, and Peter Cohen; Andrew Bush; Eric Foster; Sarah Karlinsky â SPUR; Tom Radulovich â Livable City; Jazzie Collins; Joel Koppel â SF Electrical Construction Industry; Michael Theriault â SF Building Trades; Dan Murphy; Tim Colen â Executive Director, SF Housing Action Coalition; Danny Campbell â Sheet metal Workers Local Union 104; Malcolm Young â Chinatown Community Development Center; Kevin Kitchingham â Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center; Lucio Sanchez â Carpenters Local 22; Marc Salomon; Brian Cochran â Carpenters Local 22; Adrian Simi â Carpenters Local 22; Jim Hewitt â Carpenters Local 22; Carl Shannon; Oz Erickson â Emerald Fund; Joe Boss; Jamie Whitaker â Rincon Hill Neighborhood Asssociation; Debra Walker; Sue Hestor; Marilyn Amini; Leo Robano; Brian McGee; Leo Cassidy; Grace Shannahan â Residential Builders Association; Herera Duffy; David Sternberg; Angus McCarthy â Residential Builders Association; Shawn Keagin â Residential Builders Association; Gary Gee - Architect</p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt">ACTION: Approved per staff recommendations and Commission modifications as follows: (1) Clarify that this new ability to defer fees is offered only to those projects that have not yet paid development impact fees; (2) Correct the ordinance to ensure that each of the effective dates for individual impact fee programs are the original date of those programs and not the effective date of this new ordinance; (3) Maintain SFMTAâs role as âimplementerâ of the TIDF. While the fee is moving into the Planning Code and the ZA may need to âinterpretâ the Code, in general the Department and MTA expect that the MTA will be primarily responsible with answering questions about this fee; (4) Ensure that in-kind contributions have been vetted with the agencies responsible for monitoring each in-kind contribution; (5) Include all fee requirements in the new process. Currently the proposal does not include the two alternative means of satisfying the open space requirement in South of Market and Eastern Neighborhoods. Section 143, Street Tree Requirements, requires a type of physical improvement that according to Article 16 of the Public Works Code can be satisfied as a fee payment when utilities or other barriers prevent planting of trees. DBIâs Fee Unit should be made aware of the street tree requirement at submittal for inclusion in the âProject Development Fee Report;â (6) Provide further consolidation of fee âdefinitionsâ. The Department has provided suggestions for this consolidation in Exhibit B which was delivered to you 1 week after the original packet. I have extra copies here and can go over this with you in more detail if you like; and (7) finally, include a legislative end-date for fee deferrals. As this legislative package is intended to counter the difficult economic times, an end-date should be added where the City would no longer allow the deferral of fees.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"><b>(b) 091252</b> [Affordable Housing Transfer Fee Restriction Alternative for Inclusionary and Jobs Housing Linkage Programs] -This Ordinance would amend the San Francisco Planning Code by amending Sections 313.4 and 315.5 and by adding Section 313.16 to add an alternative for compliance with the Jobs Housing Linkage Program and the Residential Inclusionary Affordable Housing Program by allowing a project sponsor to defer 33% of its obligation under either Program in exchange for recording an Affordable Housing Transfer Fee Restriction on the affected property providing that 1% of the value of the property be paid to the Citywide Affordable Housing Fund at every future transfer of the Property.</p>

<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify"></p>
<p style="TEXT-ALIGN: justify; LINE-HEIGHT: 12pt">SPEAKERS: Tim Colen; Sue Hestor; David Sternberg; and Angus McCarthy</p>
<p>ACTION: Approved per staff recommendations as follows: Clarify that this new ability to defer fees is offered only to those projects that have not yet paid housing fees; and (1) Tighten the procedures around the âAffordable Housing Transfer Fee Restrictionâ. The proposed Ordinance should be amended to require the Fee Unit in DBI to be presented with the required NSR at specific points such as âFirst Construction Permitâ. In addition MOH and the Fee Collection Unit in DBI should be required to (instead of authorized to) record separate NSRs on subsequent subdivisions of the property; (2) Remove the option to pre-pay the âpresent valueâ of the restriction. The current draft of the proposed legislation allows property owners to pre-pay the âpresent valueâ of the restriction at any time to remove the NSR, although the âpresent value of the restrictionâ is not reduced through previous transfer payments. However, based on feedback received from a variety of stakeholders, the Mayorâs Office, OEWD and MOH have all agreed that this provision will be eliminated in subsequent amendments. Through an oversight, this recommendation was not included in the original motion so if the Commission supports this it would need to be added to the motion; and (3) include a legislative end-date for fee deferrals. As this legislative package is intended to counter the difficult economic times, an end-date should be added where the City would no longer allow the deferral of fees. </p>

The Project proposes to upgrade and replace portions of the CSPL2, which extends (south to north) from the Crystal Springs Pump Station at the base of Lower Crystal Springs Dam in an unincorporated area of San Mateo County, through the Town of Hillsborough and the cities of San Mateo, Burlingame, Millbrae, San Bruno, South San Francisco, Brisbane, Daly City, and into the City and County of San Francisco, terminating at the University Mound Reservoir in southeastern San Francisco. The SFPUC has identified 19 sites along the 19-mile CSPL2 alignment where improvements are proposed to meet seismic reliability level-of-service goals. The improvements include pipeline rehabilitation and seismic retrofit activities at 15 sites and general improvements to protect the pipeline from corrosion and exposure at 4 sites. In addition to these improvements, the SFPUC proposes to install new cathodic protection equipment at 9 locations and insulated flange joints (referred to as electrical isolation) at 31 locations along the CSPL2 alignment to further protect the pipeline from corrosion. <b>Written comments will be accepted at the Planning Departmentâs offices until the close of business on January 25, 2010. </b></p>
