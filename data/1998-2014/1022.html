The existing hotel/motel is currently operating, and is a legal non-conforming use as it was constructed in 1955, prior to neighborhood commercial zoning controls.  The project site is in an NC-3 (Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The proposed project would be required to get Conditional Use Authorization for the hotel use from the Planning Commission under Section 790.46 of the Planning Code. </p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">BOS:</font></p>

        <p>- On May 13, 2003, the full Board of Supervisors heard the following appeals:</p>

        <p><i>1) 2690 Harrison Street</i></p>

        <p>- This is a 54-unit residential project.</p>

        <p>- The Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition filed an appeal.</p>

        <p>- After a 4-hour hearing on the matter, public comment was closed and the item was continued until this morning</p>

        <p><i>2) 1017 Ocean Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- Verizon Wireless antennas.</p>

        <p>- This item was continued to June 10, 2003.</p>

        <p><i>3) Other appeals</i></p>

        <p>- Wharf J-10:  fish processing tenants of this pier have filed an appeal of the statutory exemption from CEQA review for the emergency demolition that was issued on April 15.  The Board at its June 10, 2003 hearing will hear the appeal.</p>

        <p>- O'Shaugnessy Dam Negative Declaration:  the appeal for this project will be heard on June 10, 2003.</p>

        <p>- Secondary Unit Legislation:  an appeal was filed for this legislation.  The appeal was filed for environmental review exemption by a group called Coalition to Protect our Neighborhoods. </p>

        <p>- State law grants a Statutory Exemption from environmental review for secondary unit legislation that affects single family dwellings, but not for multiple family dwellings.  The Planning Department issued a General Rule Exclusion Exemption from CEQA review for that portion of the legislation that affects multiple dwelling units, and it is that determination that has been appealed.  No date has been set for the appeal hearing, but it is expected that this will be heard by the full Board prior to the issue returning to this commission for your recommendation on the legislation.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  2690 Harrison Street</i></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Erick Quezada</font></p>

        <p>- The Board of Supervisors was able to hear from a diverse group of people regarding this item.</p>

        <p>- There were a lot of racist comments at the hearing.</p>

        <p>- Family housing and affordable housing are priorities in the Eastern Neighborhoods.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">James L. Collins</font></p>

        <p>- He felt insulted by the comments made at the Board of Supervisors regarding this project.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor made very racist comments that were inappropriate.</p>

        <p>- He read the full text of the remarks made by Mr. Milton Gaines.  </p>

        <p>- There were sentences in it that he would have disagreed with, but he takes the position of defending the right of Mr. Gaines to say what he said.</p>

        <p>- He read it in a different context than with the emotionalism by which those remarks were made.</p>

        <p>- He believes that Mr. Gaines is sending many people the full text of his remarks with a letter of explanation.</p>

        <p>- Mr. Gaines empathizes with the problems in the Mission.  [For instance], there were statements that identified in particular where poverty was coming from, etc.</p>

        <p>- Could Mr. Gaines have said the same thing in a different way?  Yes, he could have. </p>

        <p>- This is a healthy dialogue and it's a good one.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">David Lupo - Carpenter's Union</font></p>

        <p>- He was also shocked at the comments that the project sponsor made.</p>

        <p>- There are no Latino workers at the job site of this project.</p>

        <p>- The project is consistent with the long range planning for the Mission District.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor did make some inappropriate language.</p>

        <p>- His clients have worked very successfully with Potrero Boosters and the Dogpatch Neighborhood Association.  They have received approval for their projects from both organizations.</p>



        <p>- This plan has one fatal flaw.  It is perceived from a biased point of view that there must be a very [heavy] handed effort to provide an expansion of PDR uses and to protect PDR uses from new residential/commercial development.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marina Secchitano - ILWU</font></p>

        <p>- The designation of mixed-use residential between Third and Illinois and Mariposa and 25<sup>th</sup> Streets need to be thought out and that there be a buffer zone.</p>

        <p>- The shipyard works 24 hours [a day] and this could cause problems with residential use.  There is a lot of activity that does not need to be shared with residential use.</p>

Section 151 of the Planning Code requires one parking space be provided for each six beds, with a minimum of two spaces required.  The proposed project includes one parking space and a variance is requested to provide only one off-street parking space.  Section 134 of the Planning Code requires a minimum rear yard of 25% of the total depth of the lot.  The existing rear yard is 10% and does not therefore meet this requirement.

        <p>- She displayed an aerial photograph of the properties that will be impacted by the proposed addition.</p>

        <p>- The adjacent neighbor will see a solid wall and will loose sunlight to their property.</p>

        <p>- She is asking to not have the third story built and to set back the other proposed addition to allow light to come through the windows.</p>

        <p>- There are already to large buildings eliminating a yard.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor will be making an addition to a nonconforming lot.</p>

        <p>- He asked to have the building lowered by 2 feet, 2 inches but the project sponsor completely disregarded it.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Victor DeRossi</font></p>

        <p>- He is a contractor and was involved in the construction and design the building he lives in.  He tried to design the building so as not to have any negative impacts on the adjacent neighbors.</p>

        <p>- He is disappointed to see this project have a solid wall next to his building.</p>

        <p>- He is just asking that the project sponsor revise the project so as to protect their light and air.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard Berkowitz</font></p>

        <p>- He filed for a Discretionary Review because the project is not in conformance with the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

        <p>- Allowing the proposed construction will make the building too large and bulky.</p>

        <p>- He is just asking to have the proposed project reduced 2 feet, 2 inches.</p>

        <p>- He requested that the Commission modify this project by either eliminating the top floor or reducing it by 2 feet, 2 inches.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ralf Mennem</font></p>

        <p>- He opposes the addition of the top floor because it will make the building gigantic.</p>

        <p>- This top floor would have a negative impact on his view as well as block the amount of sunlight he receives to his home.</p>

        <p>- He requests that the Commission eliminate the top floor.</p>

He would like to explain that when the project first came about it was a lot smaller.  the project has changed and his wife is now against the largeness of the addition.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Debra Stein</font></p>

        <p>- The proposed alternatives are:  1) evict tenant from 618 Carolina and merge units, demolish/rebuild 2 units, evict from &#189; unit and expand at rear; 2) eliminate major component such as 3<sup>rd</sup> floor, elevator, find alterative access, accessible open space/relocate elevator to rear; 3) require additional setback along 624 Carolina secondary windows.</p>

        <p>- This project will not affect light and air because it will not have major impacts.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor requires an elevator because of his health.</p>
