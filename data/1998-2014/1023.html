        <ul><ul><p><u>491 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD - HOME DEPOT PROJECT</u> - Assessor's Block 5598, Lots 8, 9, 11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 21, and 28; <font class="heading2">PUBLIC HEARING ON DRAFT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT.  </font>The proposed project consists of demolition of two vacant buildings, totaling 107,346 square feet (sq.ft.), and construction of a home improvement store (Home Depot). The 153,089-sq.ft.-project would consist of a two-story main store with approximately 96,250 sq.ft. on the main floor, 38,405 sq.ft. on the second floor, a 9,888-sq.-ft. enclosed greenhouse and an approximately 8,546-sq.ft. outdoor-garden center. A separate parking garage consisting of two levels plus rooftop parking totaling 550 parking spaces would also be constructed on this 5.73-acre site. The buildings would be approximately 40 feet in height. Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Bayshore Boulevard, where Cortland Avenue dead-ends into Bayshore Boulevard, and secondary access would be on Loomis and Waterloo Streets. A customer pick-up lane would be provided on the ground level of the parking facility with egress onto Bayshore Boulevard, just north of the Cortland Avenue intersection. Four freight-loading spaces would be provided. The project is located within the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. The site is within the Planning Commission's adopted Industrial Protection Zone (IPZ) and is located in a M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 65-J height and bulk district. </p>

    <p><i>Re:  Continuance</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Angelo P. King - SNJIR/SLUG</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Chasity Hayes - Young Community Developers, Inc.</font></p>

    <p>- She is in agreement with the continuance of this project.</p>

    <p>- Home Depot should be able to employ people of the community.</p>

    <p>- They should not have had to be here because Home Depot should have included them in the development of the project in the first place.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Latrice Hawkins - Young Community Developers, Inc.</font></p>

    <p>- She has lived in the Bayview for 35 years.</p>

    <p>- He is here on behalf of the community.  He is in agreement with a continuance of this project.</p>

    <p>- In order to have a full community meeting with Home Depot, he would like to have the continuance to 60 days instead of to May 15, 2003. </p>

    <p>- It is impossible to have all the issues dealt with in a 15-day period.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

    <p>- She asks for [a continuance of] 120 days because there are a lot of people who are being ignored.</p>

    <p>- They provide a lot of jobs to members of YDC.</p>

    <p>- They want Home Depot to understand that the entire community supports this project. But parties involved need to be able to sit at the table and discuss issues.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Anna Shimko - Cassidy, Shimko &amp; Dawson</font></p>

    <p>- None of the people who spoke today have spoken on the matter of the environmental aspects of the project.</p>

    <p>- She feels that the continuance date of May 15, 2003 for the draft EIR should remain.</p>

    <p>- They have been working with various organizations in order to provide funding and hire people in construction jobs.</p>

    <p>- Home Depot is doing more here than in any other community to hire people from the neighborhood.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mike Abaty</font></p>

    <p>- He feels that he will be able to prove through performance that Home Depot will hire from the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- He does not believe that continuing the EIR is a good method.</p>

    <p>- Home Depot is not a racist company.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mathew Thomas</font></p>

    <p>- He has been meeting with community-based organizations.</p>

    <p>- He knows that not everyone will be getting what he or she wants, but Home Depot is not a racists company.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Dan Conway</font></p>

    <p>- The Bayshore Boulevard Merchants have signed a petition that is in support of Home Depot.</p>

    <p>- Any delay of this process will hurt the merchants.</p>

  </ul><p>5. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

    <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

    <p>1) She apologized for leaving early last week because of her illness.</p>

    <p>2) She received a letter from staff concerned that Commissioners are leaving early during the hearings.  As a result, many cases are being continued because of tie votes.  She suggested that Commissioners commit to staying through the entire hearing on Thursdays.</p>

    <p>3) When packages are delivered to her, she instructed that they be delivered to the Planning Department and not the Bay View Opera House.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

    <p>1) He asked staff what the continuance calendar looks like.</p>

    <p>2) He suggested the possibility of having an additional hearing date to take care of the entire backlog.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

    <p>- At the April 10<sup>th</sup> hearing, she requested that the project on 150 Broadway not be continued to May 15.  This item is shown on the draft calendar for May 8 as a continuance to May 15.</p>

    <p><i>Commission Secretary:</i></p>

    <p><i>- She responded to Commissioner Feldstein that she will continue the item to another date.</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Hughes:</font></p>

    <p>- Although there were a lot of continuances last week, the Commission has made genuine efforts to take care of cases at each hearing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

    <p>- Is it prudent to add another hearing in the next month or two?  He agrees with taking care of the backlog?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>

    <p>1) He asked to have the Transportation Authority come and give a presentation by Jose Moscowitz to let us know what are their long-term goals because this will impact parking in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>2) He would also like to have the Redevelopment Agency present what plans they have over the next 5 years.</p>

    <p>3) He would need to know the number of registered cars between 1990 and 2000 in order to understand if there has been a net increase over the years.</p>

    <p>4) There is a need to have the meeting in the Board of Supervisors' chambers to accommodate the pubic so they can articulate their concerns on the Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

    <p>- She suggested that staff contact the Board of Supervisors to reserve the Board Chambers for the hearing of June 5, 2003.  Staff is also to request funding from the Board of Supervisors to broadcast the hearing.  At this hearing the agenda would include only the Housing Element of the General Plan.  We should have representatives from MUNI and the Redevelopment Agency as requested by Commissioner W. Lee.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>6. Director's Announcements</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Acting Zoning Administrator: </font></p>

    <p>- He feels that adding two meetings in a week is very demanding on staff.</p>

    <p>- He would suggest having a meeting on May 29 because it is currently a canceled hearing date on a 5<sup>th</sup> Thursday.</p>

    <p>7. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOS</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Land Use Committee</font></p>

    <p><i>Re: Triangle Light Standards</i></p>

    <p>- The Committee sent to the full Board the Landmark Designation ordinance for the Golden Gate Triangle Light Standards.  The historic street lamps, of which there are approximately 189 standing today, are found in the Triangle District, which is the area bordered by Market, Mason and Sutter Streets.  This ordinance was actually referred back to the Board in 2001 after both the Landmarks Board and the Planning Commission had recommended approval.  It was first carried at the Board by then Supervisor Leno and has now been resurrected by Supervisor McGoldrick and will be up for a vote at the full board this coming Tuesday, May 6.</p>

    <p><i>Re: 2690 Harrison Street - Conditional Use Appeal </i></p>

    <p>- The Commission on March 20, 2003 approved this Conditional Use for a 54-unit residential project.</p>

    <p>- The appeal was initiated by the Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition through the signatures of five members of the Board (Supervisors Maxwell, McGoldrick, Daly, Amiano, and Gonzalez).  It will be heard on Tuesday, May 13, 2003.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOA</font></p>

    <p>1) <i>1168 Folsom Street</i> (which was heard by the Director of Planning and the Zoning Administrator on September 17, 2003).  </p>

    <p>- This is a 20 dwelling unit project with two small commercial spaces.  The Director denied the project because the community planning process had not occurred.  The project is located in the former IPZ and, at the time, it was not clear where the zoning was going in the future.  </p>

    <p>- The Board of Supervisors on October 28, 2002 upheld the Director's decision.</p>

    <p>- At the Board of Appeals last night, staff was in agreement that they overturn the Director's decision and that the project go ahead.</p>

    <p>2) <i>75 Miraloma</i>, this was another project heard by the Director of Planning and the Zoning Administrator on October 10, 2003.</p>

    <p>- The Director approved this project.</p>

    <p>- The Board of Appeals upheld the decision of the Director.</p>

</ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">D. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED</font></p>

  <ul><p>At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

    <ul><p><i>Re:  3725 Buchanan Street</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

    <p>- The information given by the antenna expert was lacking in data.</p>

    <p>- It is important that a health analysis be done on the dangerous affects these antennas transmit.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jacqueline Clemens</font></p>

    <p>- This is the 8<sup>th</sup> time they have come before the Commission.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission doesn't &quot;rubber stamp&quot; this project.</p>

    <p>- There are a lot of people who are opposed to this project.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  40-50 Lansing Street (aka 35 Guy Place)</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patrick Malone</font></p>

    <p>- He would like to have this project denied.</p>

    <p>- Many residents have submitted letters opposing the project.</p>

    <p>- There is no compelling reason to build luxury units in the area.</p>

    <p>- There has been a lot of apartment unit construction built in the area recently. </p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sara O'Malley</font></p>

    <p>- She displayed photographs of Guy &amp; Lansing Streets showing that the area has blind curves and that traffic would be hazardous.  This is a dangerous situation for pedestrians.</p>

    <p>- The loading dock would cause a lot of problems.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Tule West</font></p>

    <p>- The building that currently is located at this location has an interior loading area.</p>

    <p>- There has not been proof that there is a need for these units.</p>

    <p>- She would like to have the loading dock be on-site if there is to be 100% lot coverage.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Drina Boban</font></p>

    <p>- She urged the Commission to vote against the Conditional Use and the Variances.</p>

    <p>- The girth of the building does not fit in the alley.</p>

    <p>- The area is very dangerous.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Andrew Junius - Reuben and Alter</font></p>

    <p>- Today is the 7<sup>th</sup> hearing on this project.</p>

    <p>- There are about 20 people here who are in support of this project.</p>

    <p>- This is the place for housing and it is a great project.</p>

    <p><i>2545 Greenwich Street </i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mark Ong</font></p>

    <p>- He stated the importance to his family to have the merger allowed.</p>

    <p>- None of the neighbors are opposed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

    <p>- Every time a unit is lost in San Francisco another one needs to be built and it rarely is affordable.</p>

    <p>- There is a quality of life that is lost when there are mergers.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>O'SHAUGHNESSY DAM DISCHARGE MODIFICATION PROJECT</u> - O'Shaughnessy Dam is located at Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, in Yosemite National Park (Tuolumne County).  The area is accessed by Camp Mather Road off Highway 120.  <font class="heading2">Appeal of a Preliminary Mitigated Negative Declaration</font>. The project consists of modifying the piping at O'Shaughnessy Dam that controls discharge to the existing 108-inch Canyon Power Tunnel pipeline (or penstock) at the base of the dam, and the downstream water transmission system. The piping modification involves construction of a new 60-inch pipeline to allow withdrawal of water from a higher level in the reservoir, to be used when turbidity in the reservoir is above the allowable level.  The project also involves demolition of the lower valve house.  The purpose of the project is to improve the water quality and water supply from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the City and Country of San Francisco and its water customers by constructing a second higher outlet to the aqueduct from the reservoir.</p>

    <p>- He is a professional mechanical engineer.</p>

    <p>- He has worked for the Hetch Hetchy project for many years.</p>

    <p>- Lines longer than 60 diameters ones should be used because they will prolong the life of the line.</p>

    <p>- The water from the reservoir is used for clean water.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Winchell T. Hayward</font></p>

    <p>- He worked for the Hetch Hetchy project as an engineer for about 20 yeas.</p>

    <p>- He is very familiar with the entire project.</p>

    <p>- He cannot understand how the water in the Hetch Hetchy reservoir could be considered turbid beyond an exceptional point.</p>

    <p>- He believes that there is no turbidity to justify the expense for this project.</p>

    <p>- He thinks that this project should not be done because it is too much money.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Rizzo - Sierra Club</font></p>

    <p>- The Sierra Club supports the appeal.</p>

    <p>- Regarding the question of turbidity, PUC has a capitol improvement plan that is a very large scale plan.  This project is not in the plan.</p>

        <p>The following language has been added to the water quality description:</p>

        <p>&quot;The proposed project would not involve construction activity on the reservoir side of the dam.  Therefore, no project-related impacts associated with water quality of the reservoir, including increased turbidity, would occur.&quot;</p>

The proposal is to demolish an existing four-story, approximately 88-foot high vacant building originally used as a lodge building for the Knights of Columbus, and most recently as office space.  The existing building would be replaced with a new five-story, approximately 78'-0&quot; high building that would house administrative and some on-site service functions of the St. Anthony Foundation which provides a variety of services to homeless and other disadvantaged individuals.  The proposed facility at 150 Golden Gate would function as part of a larger campus of St. Anthony's and would specifically provide space for administrative offices, counseling, health and job training services, and, temporarily, some dining services, until a new dining and residential structure could be constructed across the street.</p>

    <p>- The issues he has are: traffic, drug dealing, public urination, public exposure, pigeon feeding, etc.</p>

    <p>- They have spoken with St. Anthony's and St. Boniface, and the message from them was that it was not their people who were causing all the problems--basically saying that they were not going to be responsible for the problems going on outside.

    <p>- He owns the building adjacent to 150 Golden Gate Avenue.</p>

    <p>- Procedurally he was not notified from St. Anthony's about this meeting.</p>

    <p>- The project is located in the North of Market Special Use District.  He understands that there is no commercial use above the second floor allowed in this Special Use District.  It is not just a philanthropic use.</p>

    <p>- He supports what St. Anthony's is trying to do but the line to get into the foundation needs to be inside because it blocks the entrance to his building.</p>

    <p>- This is certainly a need for the homeless.  However, he has a dream of a cleaner, safer neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- St. Anthony's needs to take care of the neighborhood problems before this project is approved.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Elaine Zamora</font></p>

    <p>- She is a property and business owner on Jones Street.</p>

    <p>- There should be no question that these services are good services, yet it is also a magnet for problems in the community.</p>

    <p>- The historical fa&ccedil;ade has not been considered for preservation.</p>

    <p>- She is also concerned about the continued negative impacts from the services administered by St. Anthony.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Lea Curry</font></p>

    <p>- She lives on Jones Street.</p>

    <p>- There are about 30 drug dealers in a shelter near by.</p>

    <p>- She is willing to help St. Anthony clean up the area because she is part of the community.</p>

    <p>- She wants this project to go in but it needs to be delayed in order to discuss all the issues.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Terrance Alan - Building Owner</font></p>

    <p>- He owns a business about 1&#189; blocks away.</p>

    <p>- Most of his customers come from tourists.</p>

    <p>- Many of his patrons were mugged at night and there have been many complaints about all the problems in the area.</p>

    <p>- If St. Anthony's were a nightclub, the San Francisco Police Department would have closed them down because it would be a nuisance to the community.</p>

    <p>- He urges the Commission to extend their decision because there is need for more dialog.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Continuance</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Marilyn Amini</font></p>

    <p>- It is very important that the Commission continue this item because there has been inadequate notice.  A lot of people do not know that this item is on the agenda.</p>

    <p>- There have been eight neighborhoods that have been included in the Better Neighborhoods Program, but there are a lot of other communities that have not been included.</p>

    <p>- This is something that has major impacts and the citizens of San Francisco need to be able to respond to this.</p>

    <p>- When there are cumulative negative affects, there should be an EIR issued.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Carlista Shay</font></p>

    <p>- She was here for another reason and she just found out about this.  She lives in the corridor in question.</p>

    <p>- She feels that more time is needed to notify all of the residents in this area.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Steven Currier - Outer Mission Neighborhood Association</font></p>

    <p>- His organization deals with a lot of housing and code violations.</p>

    <p>- His organization pays close attention to issues related to planning.</p>

    <p>- He just found out about this and would like to have it continued.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mike DeCastro</font></p>

    <p>- He just found out about this about one week ago and the rest of his neighborhood has not been notified either.</p>

    <p>- He requests to have this item continued and notify people properly.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Hiroshi Fukuda</font></p>

    <p>- He presented a notice from Supervisor McGoldrick of a town hall meeting regarding this item on May 7.</p>

    <p>- This is a very important item and it should have been presented a long time ago.</p>

    <p>- Many groups know about this but once the general public knows about this they will be very concerned about it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Judith Berkowitz</font></p>

    <p>- She hopes that this will be one of many hearings on this item.</p>

    <p>- There should be more discussion about the different points within the element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ted Williams</font></p>

    <p>- This is such an important item that if everyone involved would be notified, the Civic Auditorium would have to be used for the hearing.</p>

    <p>- It is imperative that the Commission require a more through review on the negative impact this item will have for all San Francisco residents.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bill Sonsini - West of Twin Peaks Central Council</font></p>

    <p>- He would like to have this matter continued for at least 60 days.</p>

    <p>- They were not noticed about this item.</p>

    <p>- Although they were privileged to hear Dr. Ghosh speak to them about the element, they were not aware of the process.</p>

    <p>- There is no need to rush forward on something that will cause so much impact.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Marylou Lescarry</font></p>

    <p>- She agrees that this should be continued.</p>

    <p>- There are no more of the reports at the Planning Department, and there should be more readily available to the public.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Philip Darsey</font></p>

    <p>- He was not aware of this and it will have a major impact where he lives.</p>

    <p>- He agrees to a continuance.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Maureen Bender</font></p>

    <p>- She is concerned because San Francisco is such a beautiful city where there are a lot of residential communities for families.</p>

    <p>- It would be terrible to spoil these neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission continues this item.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joan Gerardo</font></p>

    <p>- She favors a 60 days extension.</p>

    <p>- There has not been a housing element for 12 years.</p>

    <p>- It is not the responsibility of volunteer neighborhood associations to do the job of the Planning Department to notify people.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ramona Albright</font></p>

    <p>- She is in agreement with a continuance.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Thom McDonough</font></p>

    <p>- He is in agreement with a continuance.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- He supports a continuance to this item.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Fred Snyder</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jill Kent</font></p>

    <p>- There are still a lot of people who do not know about this item.</p>

    <p>- She requests that this item be continued until there has been proper notice to the residents of San Francisco.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(Name unclear)</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Merits of Project</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Darryl Higashi</font></p>

    <p>- There will be funding for the housing element plan.</p>

    <p>- San Francisco does not have an acceptable and/or complete housing element.</p>

    <p>- There are other jurisdictions that have met their deadline.</p>

    <p>- As the Commission has these meetings and/or debates, they will continue to implement comments to the housing element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joyce Calagos - San Francisco Organizing Project</font></p>

    <p>- Housing is imperative in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- There is a great need for senior housing.</p>

    <p>- She would like to speed up this process.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Hiroshi Fukuda</font></p>

    <p>- There is more updated information/data on housing that the housing element could be based on.</p>

    <p>- If the housing element is based on not updated information, everything will start wrong.</p>

    <p>- &quot;Garbage in, garbage out&quot;</p>

    <p>- This document needs to be redone and projections need to be redone.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ramona Albright</font></p>

    <p>- The state mandated targets need to be revisited.</p>

    <p>- Even though Prop M is always being violated, it should still be kept in mind.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Chris Durazo - South of Market Community Action Network</font></p>

    <p>- There are some points in the Draft Housing Element plan for the South of Market area.</p>

    <p>- Affordability needs to be in the SOMA area.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission moves this forward quick and it gets amended appropriately.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eric Quesada - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition</font></p>

    <p>- He would like to see working class people be represented in the housing element.</p>

    <p>- In San Francisco there is not just a housing crisis but also an affordable housing crisis.</p>

    <p>- This needs to be moved forward quickly.</p>

    <p>- Other parts of the housing element need to be implemented and meet the needs of the people.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ada Chan - Mission Anti-Displacement Coalition</font></p>

    <p>- She is here to support the approval and the timing of the housing element.</p>

    <p>- It is nice to see on paper all the issues they have been presenting to the Planning Commission.</p>

    <p>- Affordable housing means that waitresses, janitors, etc. would be able to afford housing in their neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- She encourages the Commission to adopt zoning in the Eastern Neighborhoods.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Stephen Johns</font></p>

    <p>- He would like to ask why so many people were not noticed and urged that [staff/commission] try to fix this problem in the future.</p>

    <p>- He feels that this is being rushed.</p>

    <p>- He does not feel that affordable housing will come out of the housing element.</p>

    <p>- The July 1 deadline is not enough time to notify everyone in the City.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Lupo - Carpenters Union</font></p>

    <p>- Affordable housing and jobs are needed in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- As this moves along, there should be restrictions on who gets to do the jobs.  When there are construction jobs in neighborhoods, people from their neighborhood should be able to work at these construction jobs.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Fabris - CEO San Francisco Association of Realtors</font></p>

    <p>- The housing element is silent on how housing will be developed.</p>

    <p>- The housing element avoids differentiating between renting and ownership.</p>

    <p>- Nothing is said about ownership housing.</p>

    <p>- Home ownership has its rewards.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eve Back - Arc Ecology</font></p>

    <p>- She has been working with organizations in the Bay View.</p>

    <p>- She hears complaints from the people who are well housed yet there are people who are being threatened to move out of the City.</p>

    <p>- People who can afford market rate housing are doing well here.</p>

    <p>- There should be a commitment to use the land available and come up with programs to meet the needs that have not been met.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Peter Holden</font></p>

    <p>- He just found out about this housing element.</p>

    <p>- The new parts of the housing element seem to be very innocuous</p>

    <p>- This document states very little about home ownership.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Pauline Pill</font></p>

    <p>- She is in favor of both market rate and affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Although people need quality affordable housing, they don't want to lose their quality of life.</p>

    <p>- Parking is becoming a big issue in the Bay View.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eileen Bender</font></p>

    <p>- She found out last week about Commissioner Feldstein's membership with SPUR.</p>

    <p>- She respectfully requests that the Commissioner be excused from this item.</p>

    <p>- It is incumbent that the Planning Department notifies residences within 300 feet of proposed items.</p>

    <p>- Parking and traffic has become a real issue in the City.</p>

    <p>- Public transportation has been denied in San Francisco.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe Butler, AIA</font></p>

    <p>- He is concerned with affordable housing and retaining sound housing.</p>

    <p>- Part of the reason people are being driven away from San Francisco is the demolition of sound affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Putting new housing in neighborhood commercial districts is a good idea.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- Why have we not gotten affordable housing or housing in general?  That is the question that needs to be addressed.</p>

    <p>- The reason why we have not met all the residents' needs, is because as we downzone the city, as we put restrictions on demolitions, and create moratoriums and put builders out of work, the affordability decreases.</p>

    <p>- The problem is also that we are looking at the wrong model and this is bringing the City into bankruptcy.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Donna Crowder</font></p>

    <p>- More homeownership opportunities need to be added in the housing element.</p>

    <p>- A neighborhood could be respected and still build affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Vacant lots should be able to be developed on.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Judy Berkowitz</font></p>

    <p>- She hopes to continue discussions with Dr. Ghosh and include their concerns and suggestions in the housing element.</p>

    <p>- Without a land use element there will be no maps.  </p>

    <p>- This element should have been released a long time ago.</p>

    <p>- There should be an EIR issued.</p>

    <p>- Cars are a part of life.  People who cannot afford a house will save to buy a car.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(did not state name)</font></p>

    <p>- He has been working very hard in the South of Market Redevelopment area.</p>

    <p>- When there are meetings after meetings, people stop coming and then things are rushed through.</p>

    <p>- If this meeting were transmitted via television, more people would be able to find out about this item.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe Cassidy - Residential Builders</font></p>

    <p>- He has not been able to read the entire element since he just found out about it.</p>

    <p>- This document has a lot of  holes in it.</p>

    <p>- The numbers are very flawed.</p>

    <p>- More time is needed to analyze this.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Kepa Askinazy</font></p>

    <p>- She hopes that the community will be able to bring to the Commission current and adequate numbers and analyses.</p>

    <p>- If new buildings are being built, then housing needs to be built.</p>

    <p>- The words affordable housing in the housing element should be changed to subsidized housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alice Barkley</font></p>

    <p>- She wanted to get more than two copies of the document but was not allowed.</p>

    <p>- She volunteers to come to the Planning Department and take as many copies as she is allowed and distribute them to local organizations.</p>

    <p>- This documentation needs to be in front of people.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Archie Kipenty</font></p>

    <p>- He is a developer and has been developing in San Francisco for many years.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

    <p>- There used to be a member of the Commission who was an expert in transit.  It helps to have someone to understand.  This is a large part of what the fear is.</p>
