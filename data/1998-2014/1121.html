She is concerned about similar incidents happening at the Planning Commission.  She agrees with President Amiano that people have the right to disagree and to demonstrate but it cannot come to a point that a meeting should be disrupted and/or cancelled.<br><br>Re:  Telecommunications Guidelines<br>She saw something in the newspaper about having a moratorium on cell sites in order to allow Planning staff to update the Telecommunications Guidelines.<br><br>Director Green replied that there has been legislation regarding this that was introduced at the Board of Supervisors on Monday.   This would be a temporary moratorium on wireless communications facilities imposing interim zoning controls for a 6-month period.  This legislation would instruct planning staff to review the siting guidelines and to determine whether or not they should be amended to consider the current issues that are being raised.<br><br>Commissioner Theoharis would like to know who would provide the budget for this study when this happens?<br><br>Re:  Edgehill Way<br>Last week there was a hearing for a case on this street.  There was an article in one of the newspapers that inferred and insinuated that the reason this case was not approved was because the head of the builders association did not oppose it.  This is simply not true.  The neighborhood did so much work and the fact that they presented their case so compellingly that the Commission unanimously felt that it was meritorious for the neighborhood to have the power of Discretionary Review.<br><br>Commissioner Salinas:<br>Re:  Incident that Disrupted the Board's Hearing<br>He witnessed the situation and he believes that the incident was handled properly.  This Commission handles its affairs over and above board.<br><br>Commissioner Chinchilla:<br>Re:  flaw in the housing guide<br>Last week at the Planning Commission hearing there was a case regarding a housing project on Market and Polk.  This protect pointed out a flaw in the housing guidelines.  He would like the Director to schedule a hearing on this matter to discuss whether changes to the implementation manual of those guidelines can be made and when.  If we have high-rise protects coming through and they are producing hundreds of housing units and are asking for discretionary acts, there has to be a nexis with an imposition of an affordable housing requirement.  As he reads the housing element and the implementation guidelines, it appears that this might have been the intent but its not executed in the language.<br><br>Director Green responded that he will be working with the Mayor's Office of Housing and will schedule a hearing.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>Re:  Vacation<br>Director Green will be on vacation, for the next two meetings, Mr. Larry Badiner will be Acting Director and Zoning Administrator for the first week.  The following week, Mr. Badiner will be on vacation and Mr. Amit Ghosh will be the Acting Director and Mr. Jim Nixon will be the Zoning Administrator.<br><br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br><br>BOS<br>1) There was an appeal of a Conditional Use for an antenna at 2489-2491 Washington Street.  The project was to install three antennas at this location.  The Board overruled the Commission's decision.  Their main issue with this location was that there wasn't an adequate case made for the need of these antennas.  This was a preference 6 site and the Board felt that there were other sites more appropriate and there wasn't a need for these antennas at this location.<br><br>2) Regarding the fiscal impact to the department on studying the guidelines, he will be taking up this matter with Supervisor Amiano.  There are siting guidelines, which have been refined.  He doesn't believe that this would require a lot of staff time.<br><br>BOA<br><br>Re: 3633 Webster Street &ndash; This project consisted of a two unit building in an RH-2 District. In the 1990's the Department approved space behind the garage that was only to be used as storage. It appears that over the years the property owner had been using this space as a separate unit.  The property owner then applied for a permit to connect the lower ground floor spaces to the unit above which was being occupied by a tenant.  The Board categorized this as a dwelling unit merger and denied the permit.<br><br>Re:  2838 Sacramento Street &ndash; This project was issued a 311 notice and there were no appeals.  The permit was issued and more work was done than the neighborhood understood.  Mr. Badiner issued a stop work order.  His suspension of the project was appealed to the Board of Appeals and the work to the project continued. <br><br>Re:  272 Missouri Street &ndash; This project was a Discretionary Review, which the Commission heard in April of this year.  The Commission upheld the project and allowed it to go ahead.  The project was appealed and the Board took a motion to approve it asking for a voluntary contribution to pay the next-door neighbor $3,000 to do half of the skylights.  The Board requires 4 votes to overturn an approval and the votes resulted as 2 votes to overturn and 2 votes to deny so the motion did not pass therefore the Commission was upheld.<br><br>Re:  Building Department<br>He (the Zoning Administrator) has been working with Mr. Chiu of the Building Department.   Together they are trying to establish a permanent way to referr permits back to Planning if changes are made after the Planning Commission's/Department's action.  He has tried to make this clear.  This is a continuing process.<br><br>13.

Recently they became aware of the fact that the port has tried to get more work into the City.<br>- One of the things that they have seen is that people who want to deal with container freight don't want to pay drayage. <br>- They want good neighborhoods and want good jobs to allow people to stay in the City.<br>- Manufacturing and Light Industries need a place to work.

Shielding is typically done for transmittal rooms where you are trying to keep out interference from equipment to each other.<br>- Shielding can be done at other locations to shield other structures.<br>- In this case all the FCC requirements have been met so there is no need for shielding.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Chinchilla, Joe, Theoharis, Lim<br>NAYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salinas<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fay<br>MOTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16191<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000.1151CR                                                                                     (MARTIN:  558-6616)<br>887 POTRERO AVENUE - SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL - east side between 20th and 22nd Streets, Lot 002, Assessor&rsquo;s Block 4090 - Request for Conditional Use Authorization under Sections 234.2 and 209.6(b) of the Planning Code to install a total of three antennae: one flush-mounted to an existing penthouse on the east facade; one flush-mounted  to the western building facade facing Potrero Avenue; and one hidden within a cylinder that simulates a vent pipe at the northwest corner of the building, with the base transceiver station to be located on the roof, as part of a wireless communication network operated by Sprint PCS in a P (Public) Zoning District and 105-E Height and Bulk District.

Yet all were completed before Proposition M and with permits.<br>-  Over 52 % of this addition is a single purpose room for a spa and swimming pool.

They have lattice wood&ndash;which could be kindling wood.   This wood would cause a vertical fire.  The fire would go up and the parapet would prevent it from going horizontally. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The subject property and the adjacent property have unprotected openings on the property line facing each other.
