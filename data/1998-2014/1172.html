          8 - Appeal of a <font class="heading2">Preliminary Mitigated Negative 
          Declaration</font>. The proposed project involves the development of 
          46 senior housing units on two separate lots. A five- story, 22- unit, 
          13,919 gross-square-foot (gsf) building would be constructed at 519 
          Ellis Street, and a five-story, 24-unit, 13,600-gsf building would be 
          constructed at 430 Eddy Street. Each structure would be about 50-feet 
          tall, and would include one off-street, accessible van parking space. 
          Both of the vacant parcels are located in the block between Hyde and 
          Leavenworth Streets in the Tenderloin neighborhood of San Francisco. 
          The 519 Ellis Street parcel is approximately 3,781 square feet (sf) 
          in size, and the 430 Eddy Street parcel is about 3,575 sf in size. The 
          parcels are zoned RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined Districts, High 
          Density), and are in an 80-T height and bulk district, and are located 
          within the San Francisco Apartment/Hotel District. The proposed project 
          would require conditional use authorization for construction over 40 
          feet in a residential district, and a variance for an exception to the 
          rear yard, and exposure requirements.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- She requested that today's meeting be adjourned in memory of Bob Werby.  He is from Grosvenor Properties.  She sat with him on the Environmental Commission.  He was the most kind and generous person she has ever met.  He was very supportive to the children at the Bay View Opera House.  Mr. Werby passed away from a heart attack on Thanksgiving Day.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Re:  Backlog</font></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">- </font>For the Chief Financial Officer position, there are three candidates that have been narrowed down.</p>

        <p>- Regarding the Planner III Environmental position, he hopes that by the end of the year, there will have been a selection.  This will be a big step in dealing with the back log.</p>

        <p>- By February, the Department will have filled all of the vacant Planner classifications.</p>

        <p>Re:  Consultants</p>

        <p>- There will be a 90 day analysis of the supply and demand of production, distribution and repair (PDR) services in the City.</p>

        <p>- It was communicated to Supervisor Maxwell that staff will prepare land use recommendations for the Showplace Square in six months.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini asked:</font></p>

        <p>- What is the process regarding Supervisor Maxwell's legislation?</p>

        <p>- What is the status of projects in the pipeline?</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Director Macris Responded:</font></p>

          <p>- Supervisor Maxwell's legislation will be heard again in Committee on December 6 and voted on December 13.  There is no way to predict the outcome.</p>

          <p>- The period between now and the results of the analysis, the Director will be meeting with Paul Maltzer to bring projects before the Commission without putting the projects in jeopardy.</p>

          <p>- He will keep the Commission informed on this.</p>

        </ul><p><font class="heading2">Zoning Administrator Badiner:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Rincon Hill</i></p>

        <p>- It would be a good idea to schedule something in the future.  He will be meeting with the Commission individually and will schedule something in mid January 2005.</p>

The Project Area is located in the southeastern quadrant of the City and County of San Francisco in the area generally bounded by Cesar Chavez Street to the north, US 101 to the west, San Mateo County to the south, and the San Francisco Bay to the east.  The proposed redevelopment program would institute tax increment financing for the area added to the Hunters Point Redevelopment Project and for the Bayview Industrial Triangle Redevelopment Project, and would rezone land in the Bayview Hunters Point area.  The total allocation of net new floor area within the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area would be approximately 2.2 million square feet by 2020.  The potential mall at Candlestick Park would comprise approximately half of this new floor area and the remaining floor area would be spread throughout the activity nodes, with the Hunters Point Shoreline Activity Node receiving the greatest percentage of net new square footage.  Approximately 6,200 net new employees would work in the Bayview Hunters Point Redevelopment Area.  In addition, the Redevelopment Area would see an increase of approximately 3,600 new dwelling units by 2020.  The northern section of the Project Area is zoned Light Industrial (M-1) and Heavy Industrial (M-2).  The Third Street commercial corridor is zoned primarily Neighborhood Commercial (NC-3), with pockets of Light and Heavy Industrial zoning on the northern and southern edges of the corridor.  Residentially zoned land is located east and west of Third Street.  Residential, Industrial and Neighborhood Commercial zoning classifications are in the Hunters Point Shoreline area.  Other pockets of Neighborhood Shopping zoning are along Gilman Avenue and along Hunters Point Boulevard and Innes Avenue.  The southern portions of the Project Area generally are zoned Residential and Heavy Commercial, and Public within the Candlestick Point area.</p>

        <p>- It would be helpful to acknowledge that there are adjacent neighborhoods and not just freeways.</p>

        <p>- There are issues that need to be dealt with in regards to Cortland Avenue and Bernal Heights.</p>
