        <p><u>899 NORTH POINT STREET</u> - southeast corner of North Point and Larkin Streets; Lot 026 in Assessor's Block 0020 - Request for Conditional Use authorization pursuant to Sections 209.1 and 228.3 of the Planning Code to construct an approximately 40-foot tall, 4-story, 5-unit residential structure containing 7 off-street parking spaces in an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-family) District, the Waterfront Special Use District No. 2 and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  The project site was formerly a service station and is now in use as a parking lot.  This proposal requires Conditional Use authorization because 1) it proposes a dwelling unit density of greater than 3 units in an RH-3 District and 2) it proposes to convert a service station use to residential use.  This project is also seeking a Variance from the Planning Code, case No. 2003.0295C<u>V</u>.  </p>

Rather than leave a 22' wide gap in the North Point Street frontage, the proposal is to construct an approximately 40' X 22' portion of the project fully into the rear yard along North Point Street, leaving a comparable rear yard to the interior of the lot of approximately 1,480 square feet.</p>

        <p><u>44 LURMONT TERRACE</u> - a cul-de-sac on the north side of Leavenworth Street between Greenwich and Lombard Streets; Lot 025 in Assessor's Block 0071  - Request for Variance from the rear yard requirements of the Planning Code to construct a single-family dwelling partially into the required rear yard, within an RH-3 (Residential, House, Three-family) District, and a 40-X Height and Bulk District.  Section 134 of the Planning Code states that in an RH-3 District, in the case of any lot that abuts along both its side lot lines upon lots with buildings that front on another street or alley, the minimum rear yard depth shall be 25 percent of the total depth of the lot, or 15 feet, whichever is greater.  On the approximately 80-foot deep subject lot, this results in a rear yard requirement of 20 feet, with the south side of the lot being considered the rear.  The proposed construction would project into the required rear yard by up to 11 feet at the ground (garage) floor level, extending to within 9 feet of the south property line.  The application requesting a Variance will be heard by the Zoning Administrator.</p>

        <p>- She wished everyone a happy Chinese New Year.</p>

        <p>- She has an emergency and will be leaving early today.</p>

        <p>- She requested that legislation is forwarded to the Commission from the Board of Supervisors include a cover sheet from staff with information on the timeline for commission review and any necessary action.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>- He hopes that in the future, the Commission can weigh in on certain legislative items.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

        <p>- In the mist of the election of officers and all the other activities during last week's hearing, I neglected something very important.  I'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the valuable contributions of ex Vice President Antonini.  Although every member of the Commission is extremely important, .his dedication and commitment to his responsibilities as vice president benefited not only me and the Commission, but also the citizens of San Francisco.  Thank you.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p>- He thanked everyone for this acknowledgement.  He is happy to serve the City, the Board of Supervisors and the Mayor in any capacity he is wished to serve in.</p>

        <p>- He feels that this is a very thoughtful as well as unified Commission and is happy to be a member.</p>

        <p><u>FORMULA RETAIL USES</u> - Consideration of an Ordinance to amend the Planning Code by adding Section 703.3 and by amending Section 182 to make findings as to the need to regulate formula retail uses, to define formula retail uses, prohibit formula retail uses in the Hayes-Gough Neighborhood Commercial District and in the Neighborhood Commercial Cluster Districts at Cole and Carl Streets and Parnassus and Stanyan Streets, to require any building permit application for formula retail use to comply with the notice and design review procedures of Section 312 of the Planning Code, to provide that the burden to prove that a use is not a formula retail use rests with the building permit applicant or holder, and to provide that nonconforming uses in Residential District which are seeking to change in use to retail sales activity or retail sales establishment which is also a formula retail use must comply with the provisions of Section 703.3 , making findings of consistency with the priority policies of Planning Code Section 101.1 and the General Plan.</p>

      </ul><p>(Continued from Regular Meeting of January 8, 2004)</p>

        <ul><p><font class="heading2">(+) Supervisor Matt Gonzalez</font></p>

        <p>- He thanked everyone for their suggestions on strengthening this legislation.</p>

        <p>- It is worth noting that this legislation will only impact a small group.  The existing businesses in this City (24,600); of these (20,900) or 85 percent are single location businesses.  Another 15 percent (16,680) are multiple location businesses and of these the vast majority have two locations only.  About one percent or less of businesses would be really impacted by this legislation.  This ordinance includes impact on neighborhood character, the increase of homogenization of neighborhood commercial districts, etc.</p>

        <p>- There are some amendments he would like to address:  1) legislation is being prepared by the City Attorney that would get rid of the duplicative sections of the code related to 312 notice; 2) there would be an amendment on the findings regarding the special circumstances of hardware stores; 3) the City Attorney has offered to change the language regarding the ambiguity of the language: <u>50 percent or more of the merchandise offered for sale</u>.... to say:  <u>50 percent or more of in stock merchandise from a single distributor</u>...  This would help clarify that.  4) regarding Discretionary Reviews: he was trying to give guidance on how this consideration would be taken up by staff.  The ordinance is useful because it articulates certain specific concerns to take into account.</p>

        <p>- This ordinance is not really a one-size-fits-all that is often seen at the Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jennifer - San Francisco Soup Company</font></p>

        <p>- They have six locations in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- This legislation will hurt small and growing businesses like the San Francisco Soup Company.</p>

        <p>- This is really an anti progressive legislation.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Steven Sarver - San Francisco Soup Company</font></p>

        <p>- It would be very difficult for him to sign a lease because of this legislation.</p>

        <p>- Some of the best locations would be unavailable to him and his company.</p>

        <p>- The larger companies can take risks; smaller businesses cannot take these kinds of risks.</p>

        <p>- He and his wife have worked very hard to establish their small business.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mel Washington - San Francisco Black Chamber of Commerce</font></p>

        <p>- People have the right to small enterprise.</p>

        <p>- The customers of San Francisco vote to go or not to small businesses.</p>

        <p>- This legislation should not protect a select few and not protect small businesses.</p>

        <p>- He owns a small business and is an entrepreneur.</p>

        <p>- This legislation will have serious impacts on the people of this city and the cost that it takes for these people to live here.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Linda Magellan - Union Square Merchant's Association</font></p>

        <p>- They have great concerns about this legislation.</p>

        <p>- It is very difficult already for a business to establish a location.</p>

        <p>- There should be a way to promote small businesses as well as continue to promote all businesses.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Bruce Qualls - Real Estate Manager for Safeway</font></p>

        <p>- The current system and processes for Discretionary Review and Conditional Uses work quite well.</p>

        <p>- Grocery stores are quite essential to people.</p>

        <p>- This legislation will make it quite difficult for grocery stores to continue to establish locations.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ana Shimko - Cassidy, Shimko and Dawson - Representing Safeway</font></p>

        <p>- The Commission should advise the Board of Supervisor against this legislation.</p>

        <p>- The City is not allowed to regulate competition and that is what this legislation is doing.</p>

        <p>- Uses are permitted or essentially not permitted.</p>

        <p>- Once a business is open, their permits can be overturned etc.</p>

        <p>- The geographic information in the legislation is not clear.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Nathan Nayman - Executive Director on the Committee on Jobs</font></p>

        <p>- This measure is not needed.</p>

        <p>- There is no consensus from the small business community.</p>

        <p>- There seem to be other motives for trying to pass this legislation.</p>

        <p>- There are ways that issues related to businesses can be dealt with without this legislation.</p>

        <p>- This legislation would stop visionary entrepreneurs from establishing their headquarters in San Francisco.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Patricia Breslin - Executive Director for the Golden Gate Restaurant Association.</font></p>

        <p>- She urges the Commission to oppose this legislation.</p>

        <p>- In this difficult economic time, it is not advisable to allow this type of legislation, which stops progress for small businesses and negatively impacts the economy of San Francisco.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ken Cleaveland - Building Owners and Managers of San Francisco</font></p>

        <p>- One of the important things to remember is that local people, and many times, immigrants own chain stores.  This legislation is discriminatory.</p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission to reject this legislation.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard Ventura - Executive Director of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</font></p>

        <p>- It is very difficult for small businesses to operate in San Francisco.</p>

        <p>- Entrepreneurs should be given the opportunity to open their businesses.</p>

        <p>- The chamber opposes this legislation.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Ed Bedard - Hayes Valley Neighborhood Association</font></p>

        <p>- The association is mostly asking for neighborhood identification.</p>

        <p>- Why do business owners want to sneak in to neighborhoods?</p>

        <p>- Formula Retail uses really cost jobs.</p>

        <p>- Locally owned and operated businesses will use other local businesses and provide jobs to more than just their employees.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Matthew Baizer - Zao Noodle Bar</font></p>

        <p>- He is strongly urging the Commission to oppose this legislation.</p>

        <p>- Although he is not a destination business, he would like to expand to other neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- He receives many emails requesting that he open restaurants in other neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>- He does use local architects, lawyers, etc.</p>

        <p>- This legislation will only damage the progress of his business to other neighborhoods.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marilyn Amini</font></p>

        <p>- There are a lot of issues that really need resolution.</p>

        <p>- The Commission can request a continuance of 90 days.</p>

        <p>- Seeing the level of controversy of this legislation, Supervisor Gonzalez should agree to this </p>

        <p>- It would be to the interest of the Supervisor to grant an extension.</p>

        <p>- The Commission should not move it forward.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Peter Cohen - Hayes Valley</font></p>

        <p>- He was impressed when the Commission deliberated long and hard over the Starbucks project.</p>

        <p>- He was very impressed from by the comments of the Commissioners.</p>

        <p>- Hayes Valley requested a prohibition to these types of uses but this would probably be an exception to the rule.</p>

        <p>- Many residents will probably be happy with the notification requirements.</p>

        <p>MOTION: Motion to approve with modifications.</p>

        <p>SPEAKERS:</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Victor Reda - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <p>- His concerns are the negative effects on his living environment, safety and quality of life.</p>

        <p>- This proposal is a major change from the original proposal exposed at a Variance hearing.</p>

        <p>- It is important that no resident owner was represented at any of the deliberations when the changes were made.</p>

        <p>- As per the Residential Design Guidelines, the proposed building is not in harmony with the patterns of the surrounding buildings.  There is no respect for the pattern of building entrances.  There is no respect for rear yard patterns.  The project does not lessen the potential impact on light and air or lessen the potential impact on privacy.  Buildings should be similar in scale and roof forms should be compatible to adjacent buildings.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Todd Olsen</font></p>

        <p>- The street access to the subject proposal is one foot short of code requirement.</p>

        <p>- The garage would cause a lot of traffic and major safety issue problems.</p>

        <p>- Many of the occupants in the adjacent homes are senior citizens.</p>

        <p>- The building will be overwhelming for the entire neighborhood.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ursula Eglund</font></p>

        <p>- Because of it's unusual narrowness, having a garage on Deming Street would be quite dangerous.</p>

        <p>- It is difficult for her to understand why there would be an allowance for this type of project.</p>

        <p>- She urged the Commission to vote down this project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard McKray - EVPA</font></p>

        <p>- He has lived in Eureka Valley for 35 years.</p>

        <p>- He displayed a map of the Eureka Valley watershed pointing out that the property in question should allow more curbside parking.  There are many neighbors who have done constructions very creatively and have less of an impact.</p>

        <p>- Eureka Valley has many beautiful rock formations.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Richard Kaprowski</font></p>

        <p>- Although his lot is adjacent to the project site, he was never notified of this project.</p>

        <p>- The wall that will be built will block the light to his garden and affect the quality of life to his home.</p>

        <p>- The project will also break the pattern of the back yards on the block.</p>

        <p>- He urged the Commission to take a close look at these plans.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Tom Archer</font></p>

        <p>- He is opposed to the Variance and the setback.</p>

        <p>- He is in favor of the green open space corridor that will be affected by this project.</p>

        <p>- He feels that encroaching little by little and squeezing in this project will affect the serenity and bird life of the area.</p>

        <p>- There are beautiful rock formations in the area that should be protected.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Shana Tafilla</font></p>

        <p>- There are many people who were here opposed to the project but had to leave.</p>

        <p>- It is quite impossible to find parking on the street where the proposed project will be.</p>

        <p>- She implored the Commission to review this closely.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Rob Kosten</font></p>

        <p>- He is a tenant at a structure near the proposed project.</p>

              <p>&#183; The applicant shall modify the project so as to eliminate those ground floor elements that may lend themselves to the creation of an illegal ground floor unit.  Modifications to the ground floor are to include, specifically, the removal of the hallway from the street to the rear of the ground floor, the elimination of any shower, tub, or other bathing apparatus, and the modification of the rear stair to make it &quot;open&quot; (i.e. not able to be closed off by the simple addition of doors at either end).  The modifications should  result in the clear incorporation of the ground (aka first) floor habitable space into the second floor unit.</p>

On April 7, 2003 the applicant was issued a Building Permit (BPA No. 2002.03.20.1980) to construct a partial third story addition in conformity with the plans approved at a public hearing for Discretionary Review on September 26, 2002 (Case No. 2002.0718DDDD).  The current proposal is to enlarge the partial third floor addition by extending the approved envelope toward 48th Avenue by approximately 9 feet.

        <p>- He purchased his home five years ago.</p>

        <p>- He is seeking approval for an enclosed deck.</p>

        <p>- He has applied and paid for city permits on previous construction projects he has done to his home.</p>

        <p>- It has been seven months since he applied for this permit.</p>

        <p>- He has discovered that many of the windows are too old and require replacement.</p>

        <p>- He jumped the gun on the installation of the top floor windows.  He has submitted a letter to the Commission explaining the reason for this.</p>

        <p>- He will voluntarily remove the windows on the third floor and purchase and install the windows required by the revised plans.</p>

        <p>- He will absorb the penalty of the lost time and the cost of replacing the windows.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Lum - Project Architect</font></p>

        <p>- The main reason for the Discretionary Review was for the third floor.</p>

        <p>- The exceptional and extraordinary situation is that his client naively proceeded ahead with the proposed construction.</p>

        <p>- He is feeling very comfortable with the current plans.</p>

        <p>- This project is a small addition to an already approved third story.</p>

        <p>- The reason why this project has been designated for disapproval by staff is because it would seem as if the project sponsor is being rewarded for going ahead with construction without it having approved permits.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Edward Jong</font></p>

        <p>- He is a neighbor of the project sponsor.</p>

        <p>- He prefers the enclosed deck because it will be a more balanced design.</p>

        <p>- If the deck is open, it will be a big deck on a peaked roof.  This would be contradictory to the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- None of the houses in the area have such large decks.</p>

        <p>- She lives on Anza Street.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Harrold W. Woodson, Jr.</font></p>

        <p>- His home is three houses from the proposed house.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor has done a wonderful job improving his home.</p>

        <p>- The revised symmetrical design is more in character with the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- He recommends approval of this project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) George Orbelian</font></p>

        <p>- He lives two houses away from the project sponsor.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor's home is quite beautiful and has gone out of his way to be considerate to his neighbors.</p>

        <p>- He hopes that the Commission will support this project.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and Disapproved the Project.  The Commission required staff to issue a letter of notification to the Department of Building Inspection of changes.  They also required the project sponsor pay time and material to the Planning Department.</p>

        <p>- The new Residential Guidelines encourages light wells.</p>

        <p>- There is a need in the City to provide housing for the mentally disabled.</p>

        <p>- There is a recordation against one of the Discretionary Review requestor's from 1987 recorded by the Property Conservation Division of the Department of Building Inspection which states that the building built in 1923, in the event that the space on the East side of the building is built upon, thereby obstructing the windows of the building, a light and air easement will be obtained, or the windows will be blocked off and the required light and air ventilation will be required for the rooms affected.</p>

        <p>- There was a property conservation inspection of the occupancy back in the 80s and the permits are still open on bringing the building up to code.</p>

        <p>- There are many issues that the Building Code does not permit the Commission to tread on.</p>

        <p>- The current design proposes light wells on both sides of the property to provide reasonable accommodations to the windows that are there.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Pat Buskovitch</font></p>

        <p>- He is very familiar with the code requirements.</p>

        <p>- He has never seen a building with seven windows on the property line.</p>

        <p>- There cannot be egress windows on property lines.</p>

        <p>- The Building Department does not want people egresssing across property lines.</p>

        <p>- There are some fundamental issues with the adjoining property.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Took Discretionary Review and approved the project with the following modifications:  extend the proposed lightwell on the east side to the ground floor, thereby providing light and ventilation to the bedroom windows of the adjacent property.  The extension of this lightwell is expected to block the passageway to the rear of the proposed unit, thereby eliminating any direct access to the rear rooms and the possible creation of an illegal dwelling unit at the ground floor.</p>

        <p>- This would cause a negative impact to a second story window that leads to the kitchen.</p>

        <p>- All he is asking is that the project sponsor to find a away to either preserve the two feet separation or provide us a similar size light well.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joel Yodowitz - Reuben and Alter - Representing Project Sponsor</font></p>

        <p>- Rather than seeking to demolish this house, the project sponsor has decided to elevate the house, put in a garage and remodel the house.</p>

        <p>- He is ready to agree to a third light well.</p>

        <p>- He displayed a photograph of the front view of the subject property and the Discretionary Review requestor's home.</p>
