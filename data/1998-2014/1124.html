The proposal is to permit the conversion of an industrial building to a non-profit health center, the Native American Health Center, at the second level without providing the required additional parking spaces.  Section 151 of the Planning Code requires that one off-street parking space be provided for each 300 square feet of occupied floor area in a NC-3 Zoning District.  The Native American Health Center would occupy 9,800 square feet of floor area.  Based on the floor area, 33 off-street parking spaces would be required.  The existing three-story building has a parking deficiency of 20 spaces, which results in a net increase of 13 required spaces.  The applicant proposes no additional parking spaces.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: On July 26, 2001, the Zoning Administrator continued this matter to August 9, 2001.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Continued to the next Variance Hearing on August 22, 2001)<br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continued to Variance Hearing of August 22, 2001 at 1:00 p.m. in Room 408 at City Hall.<br>AYES:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Chinchilla, Joe, Fay, Salinas, Theoharis<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lim<br><br>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commission Matters<br><br>Commissioner Chinchilla:<br>- Last week he received a resolution from Supervisor Leno urging the Planning Commission not to approve housing projects unless they impose 10% or whatever the language was.<br>- This resolution was based on false information.<br>- He communicated to the Supervisor and pointed out that the resolution was mistaken and untrue.<br>- He challenged the supervisor to identify specifically, any conditional use that this Commission or the department had approved a project.<br>- According to his recollection there has been a trend to go beyond the 10% minimum.<br>- The department has been very conscientious about how they approve projects.<br>- If the Supervisor had done his homework, the Supervisor would have realized that the projects where they had not imposed the 10% minimum is because it was not required.<br><br>Commissioner Baltimore: <br>- Frequently she reads information on the housing needs of the City.
