The building would subsequently contain a total of 11 dwelling units.  Approximately 2000 square feet of office space would remain on the 2nd floor. The subject property is located in an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High Density) Zoning District, the North of Market Residential Special Use District #1 and an 80-T Height and Bulk District.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        <p>- She apologized to the public for not having her responses submitted regarding the Housing Element.  There was a death in her family recently and she is just getting caught up with her work load.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bill Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p>- He previously had requested information from staff regarding overlays of the existing zoning for housing in the city with an overlay of supervisor Peskin's proposal for secondary units, another overlay regarding the Better Neighborhoods Program and the zoning for housing, and finally the fourth overlay would be the latest draft of the Planning Department's Housing Element.  He would like to have this information before he makes a final decision.  There is a public hearing on July 21 and he would like to have the priorities of the other City Departments such as the Transportation Authority, etc.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

        <p>- He echoed what Commission Bill Lee mentioned and would like to see this information in a separate session other than when the Housing Element hearing will take place.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>6. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Commissioner Bill Lee's Comments:</i></p>

        <p>- He does not believe that all comments form Commissioners have been received.</p>

        <p>- Although there is an intent to have a hard copy and an electronic copy, the electronic copy might not be available at the same time as the hard copy.</p>

        <p>- There were agencies who gave presentations and he thought that they informed the Commission about their overlays.</p>

        <p>- Staff will be able to provide Commissioner Bill Lee with the graphic information about the linkages to the Eastern Neighborhoods and the Rezoning Efforts as well as all the pieces of information.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Budget Hearing</i></p>

        <p>- During the hearing of June 26, he presented to the Commission the recommendations from the Budget Analyst to the Board of Supervisors.  Later that evening he was not able to give his presentation before the Budget Committee.  The hearing actually took place the next day on Friday.  At that time, he was able to respond to the Budget Analyst's recommendations.  The Budget Analyst made several recommendations to delete several vacant positions, eliminate the budget for equipment, and eliminate a position where there is an individual on that requisition.</p>

        <p>- He went before the budget committee and supported some and disagreed with some.</p>

        <p>- The final result was the following:</p>

        <p>1. Delete three Planner II positions that are currently vacant.</p>

        <p>2. Delete a Senior Clerk Typist and a Senior Manager Position which are currently vacant.</p>

        <p>3. Reclassify a vacant Planner IV position to a Planner III position.</p>

        <p>4. Delete the $50,000 which would have been devoted to laptop equipment.</p>

        <p>5. Vehicles assigned on a full time basis to him and the Zoning Administrator are to be re-assigned for staff use.  These vehicles are used by staff anyway so this would not change much.</p>

        <p>6. Delete a Planner V position in the Information Services Unit.  This position is currently filled so the consequence would be that those who are the least senior in this classification would be affected.  In this case, that would be the Environmental Review Officer.  The person in this position has very special qualifications and experience regarding CEQA.  A reassignment would really undermine the ability of the department to be efficient.  He will submit an alternative that would be a refinement of their actions.</p>

        <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

        <p>- This legislation was amended to exempt all uses that front Pacific Street.</p>

        <p>- Passed out to the Full Board for action.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Full Board of Supervisor's Meeting of July 8, 2003:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  948-950 Lombard Street</i></p>

        <p>- The appeal was tabled off the Department's Categorical Exemption from environmental review.  Staff has rescinded the exemption determination after receiving new geotechnical information and are re-evaluating the environmental determination.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Land Use Committee Meeting of July 14, 2003:</font></p>

        <p>BOA - </p>

        <p><i>Re:  330 25<sup>th</sup> Avenue</i></p>

        <p>- This was a demolition and new construction.  The Commission did not take Discretionary Review on either demolition or new construction.</p>

        <p>- The Board upheld (+5-0) the Commission's decision except that a four foot corner of the proposed project should be cut out. </p>

        <p><i>Re:  1349 Clayton Street</i></p>

        <p>- This property was listed in the preservation listing.</p>

        <p>- The steel windows needed to be replaced with vinyl windows.  The department did not approve vinyl windows on a preservation category building.</p>

        <p>- The owner installed the windows without a permit.  An enforcement action was taken.</p>

        <p>- The building permit was ultimately submitted, the department disapproved it.  </p>

        <p>- This went before the Board of Appeals, the department was upheld on a +4-1 vote.</p>

        <p>- The project sponsor requested a rehearing but did not show up.  The Zoning Administrator was upheld.</p>

        <p>- The Board decided to grant another hearing.  There was a decision at the call of the chair to install strips to give the illusion of cottage windows.</p>

        <p>- This disturbs him (the ZA) and he will be looking at this further.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+/-) Christine Koncal</font></p>

    <p>- She would like the Commission to consider lowering the building.</p>

    <p>- There are various projects that have underground parking and some are even closer to the San Francisco shoreline.</p>

    <p>- The cost for this building has not been substantiated.</p>

    <p>- The developer has received a height limit gift.</p>

    <p>- The SOMA master plan has certain codes, especially on alleys, that this has disregarded.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Elizabeth Dodd</font></p>

    <p>- She read a letter from Chris Slattery who lives close to the 4<sup>th</sup> and Freelon project.</p>

    <p>- The quality of air in the area where this project will be built is the worst 2<sup>nd</sup> highest in the City.</p>

    <p>- There is a report from the Department of Public Health that gives this same report.</p>

    <p>- Protection is needed here more than anywhere in the City.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Robert Scott</font></p>

    <p>- This developer has been given an excess in height to his benefit, yet still cannot provide a code-complying building.</p>

    <p>- This is a residential building that does not have residential requirements.</p>

    <p>- The developer has &quot;tied&quot; the architect's hands.</p>

    <p>- This project will not provide the best allowable space.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) John Carney</font></p>

    <p>- He has looked at the exceptions and they are still not strong enough.</p>

    <p>- The height has not been straightened out.  Low cost housing is still not clear either.</p>

    <p>- There is no mention about the garage.</p>

    <p>- Smoke stacks should be installed because of the problems with the air quality.</p>

    <p>- It is a real fraud to put a 9-story building where there is none.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Kenton McSween</font></p>

    <p>- He is here as a concerned neighbor and architect.</p>

    <p>- He is concerned with the overall height of the building.</p>

    <p>- There should be units on the bottom floors to deal with security issues.</p>

    <p>- There are various projects in this area that have underground parking.</p>

    <p>- He would like the Commission to deny this project as it is currently proposed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dick Millet</font></p>

    <p>- He is having a big problem with this project.</p>

    <p>- It seems that everything has become &quot;let's make a deal.&quot;  The developer should be ashamed to have a project here </p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mary Ann Miller</font></p>

    <p>- The additional height is designed to just affect one lot.</p>

    <p>- The Commission cannot set aside all the requirements to make a place livable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Sue Hestor</font></p>

    <p>- There seems to be private guarantees and nothing is certain.</p>

    <p>- A lot of people have understood different things about what is proposed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- He cannot believe that the public is here again after there has been hearing, after hearing, after hearing.</p>

    <p>- This Commission should be proud of what they have done so far.</p>

    <p>- This project simply proves that a job can be done with so many obstacles.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><u>555 4<sup>TH</sup> STREET (AKA 557 4<sup>TH</sup> STREET)</u> -  a parcel bounded by Freelon, Welsh, and Zoe Streets; Lot 119 in Assessor's Block 3776 - Request for Conditional Use Authorization to allow [1] the construction of residential units pursuant to Planning Code Section 249.23(a) as a replacement for a previously approved but not yet constructed live/work units and [2] an exception to the base 50 foot height limit pursuant to Code Section 249.23(i). An exception from Dwelling Unit Exposure requirements is also requested pursuant to Code Section 249.23(f). Additionally, an administrative modification of rear yard requirements is sought from the Zoning Administrator pursuant to Code Section 249.23(d).

        <ul><ul><p><u>CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES  PROJECT</u> - <font class="heading2">Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report (FEIR)</font> - The California Academy of Sciences is in Golden Gate Park (Lot 1 of Assessor's Block 1700) along the easterly edge of the Music Concourse within a P (Public Use) district and an OS (Open Space) Height and Bulk District.  The project would be to build a new CAS on the site of the existing facilities.  The project would include demolition of 11 of the existing 12 buildings, and the removal of approximately 73 existing parking spaces.  The project would retain and rehabilitate Simson African Hall in place.  The Academy would retain its general location and orientation.  The new facility would include three main levels above grade, two levels below grade, and a loading area at the southwestern portion of the project site.  The new Academy building would be approximately 460 feet long and 280 feet wide, with the edges of the roof extending to approximately 520 feet long by 335 feet wide.  The building would feature a landscaped roof, the base height of which would be less than 40 feet.  Above the base, the landscaped roof would undulate to accommodate the Academy's major programmatic components beneath, with the two peak elements over the planetarium and rainforest exhibits reaching a height of about 67 feet, or approximately 13 feet beyond the highest existing point (Morrison Planetarium).  These two peaks would be set back approximately 150 feet from the roof's edge along Academy Drive.  Trellised portions of the roof would extend beyond the perimeter walls.  The floor area would increase from approximately 350,000 sq. ft. to approximately 390,000 sq. ft.  The footprint would decrease from approximately 240,000 sq. ft. to approximately 205,500 sq. ft.  This increase in area on a smaller footprint is possible because the plans significantly increase basement level areas. </p>

        <p><u>491 BAYSHORE BOULEVARD - HOME DEPOT PROJECT</u> - <font class="heading2">Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report</font> - The proposed project consists of demolition of two vacant buildings, totaling 107,346 square feet (sq.ft.), and construction of a home improvement store (Home Depot). The 153,089-sq.ft.-project would consist of a two-story main store with approximately 96,250 sq.ft. on the main floor, 38,405 sq.ft. on the second floor, a 9,888-sq.-ft. enclosed greenhouse and an approximately 8,546-sq.ft. outdoor-garden center. A separate parking garage consisting of two levels plus rooftop parking totaling 550 parking spaces would also be constructed on this 5.73-acre site. The buildings would be approximately 40 feet in height. Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Bayshore Boulevard, where Cortland Avenue dead-ends into Bayshore Boulevard, and secondary access would be on Loomis and Waterloo Streets. A customer pick-up lane would be provided on the ground level of the parking facility with egress onto Bayshore Boulevard, just north of the Cortland Avenue intersection. Four freight-loading spaces would be provided. The project is located within the Bayview/Hunters Point neighborhood. The site is within the Planning Commission's adopted Industrial`` Protection Zone (IPZ) and is located in a M-1 (Light Industrial) zoning district and within a 65-J height and bulk district.</p>

        <p>- The worst traffic on Cortland Street is in the morning because of commuters.</p>

        <p>- The Home Depot has redesigned their exits and entrances.</p>

        <p>- People will not drive on Cortland more than once.  He knows how the traffic works in this area.</p>

        <p>- It is very important that Home Depot be allowed to come to this location.</p>

        <p>- He would like to commend Home Depot for responding to a lot of the issues the public has already raised.</p>

        <p>- He read the EIR although he admits it was not the easiest thing to do.</p>

        <p>- There are a lot of major streets leading to this site so why use Cortland Avenue.</p>

        <p>- Goodman Lumber used to have super sidewalk sales and no one complained about the traffic.</p>

        <p>- There are many defects in this DEIR.</p>

        <p>- There is one main problem in the environmental impact report--there is an inadequacy with the General Plan.</p>

        <p>- He lives in Bernal Heights.</p>

        <p>- He has always taken Cortland Avenue to get to Goodman Lumber.</p>

        <p>- Many residents would like to have housing on top of the Home Depot project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Ron Morgan - BHNZ</font></p>

        <p>- He lives in Bernal Heights.</p>

        <p>- The Draft EIR does not come close to dealing with the issues made by the community.</p>

        <p>- If Home Depot is [not] allowed to mitigate it's impacts then the residents and taxpayers of San Francisco will suffer.</p>

        <p>- The Redevelopment Agency has been in support of this Home Depot because it will allow other large business to be in the area.  This is growth inducement that is not stated in the DEIR.</p>

        <p>- She lives in Bernal Heights.</p>

        <p>- The increase in traffic will add to the pollution.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Robert Mokey</font></p>

        <p>- He finds that there are a series of flaws in the DEIR regarding traffic and air pollution.</p>

        <p>- The statement made in the DEIR that there would be a 13% increase in traffic is not very realistic since he shops at the Home Depot in Colma.</p>

        <p>- A huge &quot;big box&quot; is inconsistent with this area.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Amy Kyle</font></p>

        <p>- She is concerned with the air quality and pollution this project will cause.</p>

        <p>- Vehicle pollution is one of the most important resources of air pollution.</p>

        <p>- How land and transportation is managed determines if there will be air pollution.</p>

        <p>- It is important to analyze this in a serious, well-grounded way.</p>

        <p>- This DEIR does not do this.</p>

        <p>- He has lived in Bernal Heights for about 15 years.</p>

        <p>- The main entrance and exit is by Cortland Avenue.  This will cause a driveway on the street.</p>

        <p>- The DEIR does not adequately address the traffic impact.</p>

        <p>- The traffic here will mostly be large trucks, vans, etc.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Gretchen Mokry</font></p>

        <p>- The DEIR states that there will not be significant traffic in the area.</p>

        <p>- The only way to get out of Bernal Heights is either on Cortland or Mission.</p>

        <p>- Cortland Street will be backed up and this could be a dangerous situation.</p>

        <p>- She would like to see more study on the cancer affects because of vehicle pollution.</p>

        <p>- He lives on Bernal Heights.</p>

        <p>- He &quot;tried&quot; to read the DEIR, but he did look at the charts.</p>

        <p>- The sense he got from the report is that traffic will definitely increase and the air quality will worsen.</p>

        <p>- He is opposed to such a large home improvement store.</p>

        <p>- There is a transit first policy and this project does not have a transit first policy.</p>

        <p>- He is a traffic engineer and works for Cole Hardware.</p>

        <p>- He reviewed the DEIR very thoroughly and he is concerned with the mitigation measures.</p>

        <p>- This project will generate about 1,000 vehicles per hour.</p>

        <p>- This project is the equivalent of adding another lane of traffic on the freeway.</p>

        <p>- She lives in Bernal Heights.</p>

        <p>- The DEIR is not good for Bernal or for the rest of the City.</p>

        <p>- The report does not deal with the social impacts on this City.</p>

        <p>- There will be a lot of delays in the morning and this will cause impacts on the Laid Law buses that take children to the various public schools.</p>

        <p>- All of these things will be affected by future stores that will want to open their businesses in this area.</p>

        <p>- A mid-size development will be more appropriate.</p>

        <p>- He has lived in Bernal Heights all of his life.</p>

        <p>- There is a lot of vehicle pollution in that area already.</p>

        <p>- The DEIR sates that there will be some loss of parking spaces in the area.  </p>

        <p>- There is growth inducement because Pier 1 is planning to move into the area as well.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joseph Smooke - Bernal Heights Neighborhood Center</font></p>

        <p>- The Department of Parking and Traffic study is very comprehensive.  Bernal Heights was made a pilot study because there are significant traffic and pedestrian impacts.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Cris Witteman</font></p>

        <p>- He lives on Cortland Street.</p>

        <p>- He heard that if Home Depot changed their entrance to Loomis Street it would mean that the Commission would need to look at this again.</p>

        <p>- It would be a good idea to receive the underlying data in an electronic format.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Dorin Steinberg</font></p>

        <p>- Bernal has emerged to be a jewel neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- By the year 2005 all the ramps will be jammed up.</p>

        <p>- It is so frustrating right now for him to get onto 101.</p>

        <p>- There is already heavy vehicle congestion on Cortland Street.  People from various neighborhoods will go through Cortland to get to Home Depot.</p>

        <p>- He has been to Home Depots in the bay area and knows that there is a lot of traffic, but the residents east of San Francisco will still go to the Colma Home Depot because of 19<sup>th</sup> Avenue.</p>

        <p>- The applicant of this project is Home Depot as well as one of the previous owners of Goodman Lumber.  This site has not been maintained.  If this project is developed it would make it harder for the Redevelopment Agency to justify a redevelopment area for this area.</p>
