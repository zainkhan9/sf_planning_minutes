          <ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

          <p><i>Re:  Inclusionary Housing</i></p>

          <p>- She attended the Land Use Committee of the Board of Supervisors.</p>

          <p>- They were discussing the inclusionary zoning piece, but before that, formula retail did come up. </p>

          <p>- She believes it's amending the Planning Code to prohibit formula retail uses in the North Beach Neighborhood Commercial District.  She remembers seeing a memo come through to the Commission before, but she does not believe that the item ever came before them.</p>

          <p>- She would like to have the status of this.</p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- He recalls that Supervisor Peskin introduced this some time in the Fall.  At his request, it was put on hold and the 90 days expired. </p>

              <p>- Supervisor Peskin then reactivated it but did not reintroduce it.</p>

              <p>- Because it expired at the Supervisor's request, staff never brought it to the Commission.</p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

          <p>- She asked if this case would be brought to the Commission in the future.</p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- No, it will go directly to the Board of Supervisors from the Land Use Committee. </p>

              <p>- Normally, when an ordinance is introduced at the Board of Supervisors, the Planning Department has 90 days to bring it to the Planning Commission. </p>

              <p>- The Planning Commission essentially has 90 days to act. </p>

              <p>- If there is a delay because of environmental review taking longer, staff typically asks for an extension from the Supervisor.  Often it is given. </p>

              <p>- This question was put on hold by the supervisor then he reactivated it.</p>

              <p>- It was not reintroduced.  If it had been reintroduced, staff would have then had another 90 days. </p>

              <p>- It was just brought to the Land Use Committee. </p>

              <p>- He believes any supervisor can call legislation out that is on hold at the Board of Supervisor's Land Use Committee. </p>

              <p>- That was done, it was heard. </p>

              <p>- Staff did not comment on it because the Commission had not reviewed it.  It was approved and sent on to the full Board. </p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

          <p>- It is unfortunate that the Commission was bypassed on such an important piece of legislation that really does have an impact on amending the Planning Code. </p>

          <p>- She did receive calls from members of the public who were concerned that this body never heard it. </p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- He will convey that to the supervisor. </p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

          <p><i>Re:  Board of Appeals Procedures</i></p>

          <p>- She received various e-mails regarding the Board of Permit Appeals, specifically regarding mergers and demolitions that the Commission approved or disapproved and they end up before that body. </p>

          <p>- She was wondering, what is the noticing that is given to members of the public regarding items that are appealed? </p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- He asked if the Commission Secretary could respond to that since she at one point was the Acting Executive Director of the Board of Appeals.</p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague [restated her question]:</b></p>

          <p>- Many of the items that the Commission is hearing in terms of demolition and mergers that are appealed to the Board of Appeals; what would be the noticing requirement for the public?</p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Commission Secretary responded:</b></p>

              <p>- She would have to verify this with them or the City Attorney.</p>

              <p>- To the best of my knowledge, the appeal comes from an action someone is dissatisfied with.  Other than those involved in the matter, she is not aware of any requirement for notice. </p>

              <p>- The project sponsor and all those that are involved in the case receiving constant notice/information about what is going on.  She does not believe that any particular notice goes out as is required for many Planning cases.</p>

              <p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- There is notice to people who have made a request on that particular case.</p>

              <p><b>Commission Secretary:</b></p>

              <p>- The people involved in the case do get noticed, but not the general public.</p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Olague:</b></p>

          <p>- Another comment that was made to her is that many of the decisions the Commission makes are overturned there.  She was wondering what information the Board receives.</p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- The Commission has requested a joint hearing and this will be done. </p>

              <p>- The Board receives copies of the case files that were before the Commission and whatever appellants submit.  Also, staff is in attendance for questions.  What is not submitted is a brief because there is no staff to do it.</p>

              <p><b>Commission Secretary:</b></p>

              <p>- They also get the final decision of the body that took the action.  If the Commission approved a motion, they'll get that final motion. </p>

          </ul></ul><p><b>Commissioner Antonini:</b></p>

          <p><i>Re:  Land Issues</i></p>

          <p>- A year ago, there was the situation with legislation that was eventually forwarded by Supervisor Daly in regards to demolition of 20 or more units.  Apparently there was a noticing problem.  This case did not come to the Commission but went directly to the Board of Supervisors where it was vetoed and then became legislation. </p>

          <ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator reported:</b></p>

          <p><i>Re:  1644 Diamond Street</i></p>

          <p>- This was a mandatory Discretionary Review for demolition and new construction. </p>

          <p>- The Planning Department recommended demolition.  The Planning Commission ultimately took Discretionary Review and did not approve the demolition.  However, as often requested by staff, the Commission also took DR and approved the new construction with some changes in case the matter is appealed and the Board of Appeals overturns their decision.</p>

          <p>- The Building Inspection Department informed him that he would be receiving an emergency order to demolish the building within the next day or so.   As Zoning Administrator he had to sign off on it. </p>

          <p><i>Re:  Inclusionary Housing</i></p>

          <p>- The inclusionary housing ordinance was discussed basically on how to implement it, the number of units that had been built both by the policy and by the ordinance, and receive public comment. </p>

          <p>- He got the feeling that there is a desire to revisit the inclusionary housing ordinance. </p>

          <p>- There are ways to improve the implementation.  One of the things that have been implemented, at the instigation of the Mayor's Office of Housing, is the interdepartmental working group on how it is being implemented.</p>

          <p>- He sees code amendments addressing a variety of issues.</p>

          <p><i>Re: In lieu fee</i></p>

          <p>- One item that kept coming up was the in lieu fee.  She believes that the Zoning Administrator mentioned that in the future this practice would not be supported. </p>

          <p>- She needs more detailed information on this. </p>

              <ul><ul><p><b>Zoning Administrator responded:</b></p>

              <p>- There are two projects that were approved under the policies. </p>

              <p>- One is on Haight Street.  This project was approved with on-site housing.  They sought to come in and pay the in lieu fee.  The ordinance, as it is now, says you need to make that decision prior to taking out the building permit. </p>

              <p>- The second item was 1598 Dolores Street that sought the same thing.  Unfortunately, he cannot comment on this in detail.  He is excused because he lives near there. </p>

              <p>- The general facts are that the Commission approved the first one on Haight Street.   The record will reflect the Commission disapproved 1598 Dolores.  They were approved under slightly different policies. </p>

              <p>- If another item that comes to him that is similar on 1598 Dolores then he would say the ordinance, as it is today, means you need to make a determination to build at the time of taking out the site permit.  He would not allow the project to pay the fee at this time. </p>

          <p><b>(-) Joan Fitzgibbon</b></p>

          <p>- She is a lower level tenant of the property with her husband.</p>

          <p>- She loves her apartment because of the light that comes in.</p>

          <p>- The proposed project will greatly impact her life.</p>

          <p>- She has never been asked about her opinion on the impacts of the proposed project.</p>

          <p><b>(-) Brian Merica</b></p>

          <p>- He is a tenant as well.</p>

          <p>- The main reason many people are here today is because of the negative reduction of light he and the tenants will receive with this construction.</p>

          <p><b>(-) Charles Brown</b></p>

          <p>- He lives near the proposed project.</p>

          <p>- He has lived there for about 20 years.</p>

          <p><b>(-) Jackie McMahan</b></p>

          <p>- There are procedural issues that have not been followed with this project.</p>

          <p>- There was no environmental review done, no story poles installed, the plans failed to show window openings, etc.</p>

          <p>- She also has noticed that the plans show a kitchen to be installed that is not to code.</p>

          <p>- The project states that it is a three-story home but it is actually a four-story home.</p>

          <p><b>(-) Pat Buscovich</b></p>

          <p>- He asked the Project Sponsor to build story poles.  This was not done or they were never finished.  But at the same time, they had already filed an application.</p>

          <p>- There is very little light that will survive if this project goes through.</p>

          <p><b>(-) Erin Grucz - San Francisco Heritage</b></p>

          <p>- She submitted a letter stating that the project has historical significance.</p>

          <p>- He and his wife made several efforts to meet with the neighbors.  They even had a cocktail party and invited the neighbors to discuss the project.</p>

          <p>- There is a fence that he put up a few years ago because of the neighbor's puppy and our children.</p>

          <p><b>(+) Susan Mohun</b></p>

          <p>- The fence has been up for four years.</p>

          <p>- She let the neighbors know that if there was a problem with the fence they should let her know--no one said anything.</p>

          <p>- She showed the plans to the neighbors and mentioned that the way the project was designed was their ideal.  However, they took the issues the neighbors mentioned and made revisions to the plans.</p>

        all-affordable residential structure at 2428 Bayshore Boulevard, and would 
        be comparable or larger in size and of similar quality to those in the 
        California Street project. </p>

      <p><u>230-242 TURK STREET, &quot;THE SALVATION ARMY TURK STREET CENTER&quot;</u><b> 
        </b>- north side between Leavenworth and Jones Streets, with a narrow 
        segment through to Eddy Street; Lot 025 (formerly lots 024 and 006) in 
        Assessor's Block 0338 - <b>Request for Conditional Use</b> authorization 
        to modify a project approved by the Planning Commission on October 28, 
        2003 (Case 2002.1301C). As approved, the project was to construct an 8-story 
        building with approximately 109 below market rate dwellings for adults 
        in recovery and older foster care youth. The project included a gymnasium, 
        swimming pool, chapel and multipurpose room on the ground floor, with 
        social service offices and youth recreational areas and some studio dwellings 
        on the second and third floors, with dwellings on the remaining floors, 
        all built over an underground parking level accessed from Turk Street 
        and containing at least 32 off-street parking spaces. As proposed for 
        modification, the project would increase the number of dwelling units 
        from 109 to 113 units and would add a fourth story to the approved three-story 
        element at the rear of the lot. The roof at the rear would then be approximately 
        49 feet in height and contain approximately 3,000 additional square feet 
        for a community space/dance studio. Concurrently, the Zoning Administrator 
        will consider a request to modify previously granted variances. The subject 
        property is in an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined High-Density) 
        District and located within the North of Market Residential Special Use 
        District and an 80-120-T Height and Bulk District.</p>

        will consider a request to modify previously granted variances for rear 
        yard and off-street parking requirements. As proposed for modification, 
        the project would increase the number of dwelling units from 109 to 113 
        units and would add a fourth story to the already approved three-story 
        element at the rear of the lot, both of which increase the required number 
        of off-street parking spaces by 8 additional spaces. The modified project 
        includes the same number of spaces originally approved (32), which is 
        now 64 spaces under the required amount. The modified proposed addition, 
        to be built above a previously approved element, obstructs the required 
        rear yard. The subject property is in an RC-4 (Residential-Commercial
