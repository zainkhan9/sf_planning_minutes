    <ul><p>At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sharon Johnson - Senator John Burton's Office</font></p>

    <p>- She read a letter from Senator Burton who is in support of the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Salinas - San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council</font></p>

    <p>- He is asking that the Commission and the Board support the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Emilio Cruz - Vice Chair of SPUR</font></p>

    <p>- He read a letter from SPUR who is in support of the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Rebecca Kaplan - AC Transit Board of Directors</font></p>

    <p>- It is her believe that San Francisco's most pressing commuter problems are when cars are driven.</p>

    <p>- She urged the Commission and the Board to move this EIR forward.</p>

    <p>- This project has attracted money from various places and it would be extremely beneficial to allow the project to proceed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jane Morrison - San Francisco Democratic Party</font></p>

    <p>- The Democratic Party completely supports the EIR and would like to get this terminal ready for action.</p>

    <p>- High-speed rail cannot happen if this project is not approved.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Schonbrunn - TRANSDEF</font></p>

    <p>- This project ties the region together.</p>

    <p>- It is appropriate that this be heard today because it is Earth Day.</p>

    <p>- He displayed a photograph of a vacant parking lot near the site where there is yet no construction equipment.</p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission and the Board to certify the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Norman Rolfe - San Francisco Tomorrow</font></p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission and the Board to certify the EIR/EIS.</p>

    <p>- The consequences of not certifying these documents could be extreme.</p>

    <p>- Failure to implement these documents would cause conflict with Cal Trains and various other transit companies.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Margaret Okuzumi - Executive Director of BayRail Alliance</font></p>

    <p>- They have been involved with this project for many years.</p>

    <p>- They previously submitted a letter expressing their support for this project.</p>

    <p>- Every detail has been analyzed and comments have been submitted.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Molly Last</font></p>

    <p>- She owns a loft </p>

    <p>- She has a lot of concerns about the bus storage.</p>

    <p>- The Giants games and families that will have to pass near this storage and will smell the gas and fumes from the buses.</p>

    <p>- This is not reasonable</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ken Bukowski - Vice Mayor - City of Emeryville</font></p>

    <p>- San Francisco wants a transit only policy so this EIR should be certified.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Gleeson</font></p>

    <p>- He lives on 2<sup>nd</sup> Street and will be affected by the bus storage.</p>

    <p>- The EIR does not address the significant issue of the gas fumes.</p>

    <p>- The agency should evaluate the issues before certifying the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bob Tandler</font></p>

    <p>- He owns property adjacent to the Transbay Terminal.</p>

    <p>- He is in favor of the project but the EIR is not sufficient.</p>

    <p>- The EIR should consider the issue of taking public land and private land.</p>

    <p>- It would be a rush to certify the EIR today.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">William Blackwell</font></p>

    <p>- He and his wife are strong advocates of public transit.</p>

    <p>- Why not delete the superfluous costs of this project and apply them for other transit needs.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Howard Strassner</font></p>

    <p>- He is very happy to be here in support of an EIR.</p>

    <p>- This is a basically great project that will do so much good for the environment.</p>

    <p>- Regarding the fumes, San Francisco has passed an ordinance regarding clean air.</p>

    <p>- Before this project gets built, diesel will be cleaner than it was before.</p>

    <p>- He hopes that the Commission will certify this EIR and get the project started.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Walter Johnson - San Francisco Labor Council</font></p>

    <p>- It is time to get this project moving.</p>

    <p>- This has been going on for a long time.</p>

    <p>- There is great responsibility here to certify this EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Haas - Transbay Citizen's Advisory Committee</font></p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission and the Board to certify the EIR.</p>

    <p>- This Transbay area will create a new neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- There is a lot of work to do in the future.</p>

    <p>- San Francisco is a major founder of this.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">John Spangler - Alameda Transit Advocates</font></p>

    <p>- He hopes that there will be a transit connection from San Francisco to Alameda.</p>

    <p>- He urges the Commission and the Board to certify the EIR.</p>

    <p>- Alameda Transit Advocates have submitted a letter expressing their support for these documents.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Anthony Bruzzoni - Alameda Transit District Liaison</font></p>

    <p>- He submitted a letter of support for the EIR.</p>

    <p>- He urged the Commission and the Board to follow suit of the Redevelopment Agency and certify the EIR.</p>

    <p>- The EIR is adequate and complete and follows all the necessary policy decisions.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Maurice Palumbo - Golden Gate Bridge Highway Transportation District</font></p>

    <p>- The district fully supports the EIR and urged the Commission and the Board to certify the EIR.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Matt Mathews</font></p>

    <p>- He is here requesting that the EIR be delayed so that further study can be done.</p>

    <p>- The concerns are the bus storage location and how this will have a negative impact.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">George Yamas</font></p>

    <p>- He has several problems with the EIR.</p>

    <p>- There was a meeting related to this project where it was stated that the buses could not go back during the downtime to their home counties because of air pollution issues.  Then it is stated that there won't be pollution issues.</p>

    <p>- Even it is stated that there will be low polluting buses, why isn't there a Conditional Use approval for these buses?</p>

    <p>- There seems to be a contradiction in all of this.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jan Mathews</font></p>

    <p>- She has several buildings on Stillman Street.</p>

    <p>- There are still questions regarding the emissions of the buses that will be stored.</p>

    <p>- She suggested having the bus storage on the third level of the Transbay terminal.</p>

    <p>- There are also aesthetics issues that need to be dealt with.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Andrew Sullivan - Rescue MUNI</font></p>

    <p>- This project is crucial to transit riders.</p>

    <p>- They have reviewed carefully the EIR and believe that it is a good one.</p>

    <p>- This will be a great improvement for this neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- The EIR should be approved so that the 80 Natoma project can be dealt with.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Daniel Krause - Rescue MUNI</font></p>

    <p>- He supports the EIR now.  Later the 80 Natoma project can be dealt with.</p>

    <p>- There should not be any more delay.  They will fight any blocks to delay this project.</p>

    <p>- By certifying the EIR it will provide an opportunity to resolve this conflict.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Andre Custodia</font></p>

    <p>- He would like to have an extension of the decision to certify this EIR.  He just obtained a copy and needs more time to analyze it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joyce Roy - Leave of Women Voters of the Bay Area</font></p>

    <p>- They have long advocated for this project because of the importance of regional transit.</p>

    <p>- If this project does not get approved, you will forfeit the opportunity of having high-speed rail.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jack Myers - Myers Development Company</font></p>

    <p>- The EIR and EIS is flawed and does not acknowledge his project going ahead.</p>

    <p>- He has purchased a property and has closed on about a million dollars.</p>

    <p>- They are particularly offended that his company is involved in condemnation.  His company has been in business for 30 years and he has never been involved in a condemnation process.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Andrew Ball - Webcor Builders</font></p>

    <p>- The EIR does not address the entire permitted use of the subject property.</p>

    <p>- He has never seen such a flaw as fatal as this.</p>

    <p>- They have spent hundreds of hours estimating, awarding subcontracts, etc.  </p>

    <p>- It takes considerable amount of time to do all this.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jeffrey Heller</font></p>

    <p>- He is hard pressed to believe that staff's comment about a fully approved project.  He feels that this is a mandatory part of an EIR.</p>

    <p>- He has received no notice about this.  He found out about this meeting at a ULI meeting in 2003.</p>

    <p>- If someone had discussed this project with him at that time, the alignment, as it is could have happened, [would not be] the same way it is drawn today.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Steve Atkinson - Stefell, Levitt and Weiss</font></p>

    <p>- He is representing Meyers Development.</p>

    <p>- Staff took the position that under CEQA the EIR was not required to consider the impacts on 80 Natoma since it is a vacant lot.  This is false.</p>

    <p>- The site is not just a vacant lot.  Substantial subsurface construction has already begun.</p>

    <p>- The Natoma project will have been finished long before the Transbay project will even start.</p>

    <p>- He appreciates staff's clarification that there has not been a determination of any feasibility.</p>

    <p>- He requests that this certification be delayed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Erick Lundquist - Project Architect - Heller Manus Architects</font></p>

    <p>- The impact of a fully approved project should be dealt with before approving this project.</p>

    <p>- The project of 80 Natoma is a fully compliant project.</p>

    <p>- There should be a way to get the Transbay project through if they would just talk to him.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Shepherd Heery</font></p>

    <p>- It is very important that the EIR recognize 80 Natoma as a real project.</p>

    <p>- Upon completion in 2006, 80 Natoma will contribute about three million dollars in property taxes.</p>

    <p>- The land use map for Stilman Street is in error because it shows this area is industrial.</p>

    <p>- There is also a zoning map that has left out an entire block of Stilman Street.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">John Bacan</font></p>

    <p>- He noticed in the EIR that after spending billions of dollars there will be a net increase in link transit trips of 10,000 a day in the area.  This works out to about 180,000 capital costs per new riders.</p>

          <p><u>TRANSBAY TERMINAL/CALTRAIN DOWNTOWN EXTENSION/REDEVELOPMENT </u>PROJECT - <font class="heading2">Certification of the Final Environmental Impact Report.</font> A joint EIS/EIR has been prepared for this project.  The proposed project has three major components: the construction of a multi-modal Terminal on the site of the present Terminal (that would be demolished) at Mission and First Streets; an underground extension of Caltrain commuter rail service from its current San Francisco terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to a new terminus underneath the proposed new Transbay Terminal; and establishment of a Redevelopment Area Plan with related development projects, including transit-oriented development in the vicinity of the new multi-modal Transbay Terminal.  The proposed Redevelopment Area would generally be bound by Mission, Main, Spear, Folsom, Essex, I-80, Second and Minna Streets while the Caltrain track alignment is under Townsend and Second Streets. Other subordinate components of the project include a temporary bus terminal facility at Beale and Folsom Streets to be used during construction of the new Transbay Terminal; a permanent off-site bus storage/layover facility; reconstructed bus ramps leading to the new Transbay Terminal; and a redesigned Caltrain storage yard. </p>
