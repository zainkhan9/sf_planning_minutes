She was impressed with the clarity.  It was interesting and clear.  She also mentioned the hard work of former Commissioner Beverly Mills for working long and hard on this project.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>Re:  Community Planning Workshops<br>- The 2nd in the series of community planning workshops will be held on Tuesday, February 12, 2002 from 6:00 to 8:30 p.m. at the ODC theatre that is located at 3153 17th Street, at the intersection of Shotwell.  This will be for the Mission Community Plan Area.  <br><br>On the 2nd of February was the first introductory workshop for the showplace square/potrero hill community plan area.  This meeting was held from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  The meeting was very successful in providing a starting place.  There is still a lot of work to do since there will still be three more of these workshops to be held this month.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS &ndash; None<br><br>BOA <br>January 30, 2002 Hearing:<br>Re:  760 El Camino Del Mar <br>- The Board upheld the Commission's decision but made one minor change.<br>- The Commission had originally voted to design a setback on the upper floor to allow more light to the adjacent property's rear yard.  The Board decided that this was not necessary.<br>- The Board basically modified the material selection.<br><br>February 6, 2002 Hearing:<br>Re:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1209 Vicente Street<br>- This was a conditional use that was before the Commission on January 22, 1998 for the modification of a building; reduce the parking on the site; and to keep more of a retail frontage.<br>- A series of permits were issued, but the Building Department decided that keeping the existing building was not appropriate.  The Planning Department issued a building permit that, in general, complied with the decision of the Commission, but was new construction.  Unfortunately, the Planning Department in error issued another building permit that was 4 feet higher.  The neighbors appealed the demolition, the project sponsor, who had a new representative, recognized that this 4 foot addition was inappropriate, the Board of Appeals understood that, they upheld the demolition permit but stayed the demolition permit until a new building permit was issued.  In affect, the neighbors get the opportunity to look at the new building again.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Consideration of amending the existing Planning Commission Inclusionary Housing Policies<br><br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(+) Commissioner Linda Richardson<br>- She supports the Director and Staff on this item.<br>- There are many elements that constrains housing in San Francisco.<br>- Incentives need to be provided to private developers as well as encourage non-profits.<br>- She also supports the True Hope project.<br>(+) Chris Cunnie &ndash; Representing the Police Officers Association<br>- He is working closely with the coalition, the community leaders and ministers of the City to represent 2,100 of his members.<br>- He is here to ask the Commission to support the off site exclusionary housing.<br>- Affordable housing for his members takes community policing to a new level.  <br>(+/-) Jamie Rossi &ndash; San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and Housing Action Coalition<br>- He commended the Commission for having done a great job on this policy.<br>- Yet he believes that it should help to influence the legislation that is going forward at the Board of Supervisors by Supervisor Leno.<br>- The inclusionary requirement should be a law not just a guideline.<br>- He also supports the True Hope Church of God and Union Property Capital.  This is a great example of what you can do when you put private capital with the current needs of San Francisco.<br>(+/-) Lynn Sedway &ndash; Sedway Group<br>- She has been engaged to analyze the feasibility of the inclusionary requirements.<br>- A lot of the scope was augmented to address the concerns and issues raised by the Planning Department.<br>- She does not agree with all the conclusions of this policy especially those that state that the inclusionary policy is feasible.  Although there are other conclusions she does agree with.<br>(+/-) Jim Chappell &ndash; President of SPUR<br>- For 5 years, their major program has been housing production and looking for ways to fund housing in the City.  He is also a member of the Housing Action Coalition, where 15 to 20 groups have been working for 2 years for inclusionary legislation.  This has resulted in legislation that is before the Board of Supervisor where there is wide-spread agreement by housing organizations.<br>- Although the Planning Department has been working hard on this, it is still policy and not legislation.<br>- He would like the Commission and the Planning Department to endorse the legislation that is before the Board of Supervisors.<br>(+/-) Rev. Arnold Townsend<br>- He realizes that there have been a lot of numbers being discussed but he is concerned with the real human effect on people who cannot afford to live here and have to leave.<br>- The Department has to be careful to not make requirements so high that developers don't build anything.  Then there will not be any inclusionary housing or market rate or any other kind.<br>- It was a good idea to bring this policy forward but more detail needs to be dedicated to it.<br>(+) Walter L.

Take Discretionary Review and Approve the building with the recommended modifications.<br>SPEAKER(S):<br>(-) Patrick Richards &ndash; Representing DR Requestor<br>- He hopes that the Commission will look at the compromise and why it is a good idea.<br>- The proposed home is just too bulky.<br>- The project sponsor is not a homeowner who wants to make an addition to his home, it is a developer who is making this big project at the cost of his neighbors.<br>- This project will also block the light and air on an open space that already exists.<br>(-) Bruce Bonacker &ndash; architect for DR requestor<br>- The project sponsor's building is already large.  This addition will make the building the largest in the neighborhood.<br>- On the first floor, we are proposing an alternative that pulls the rear of the building back 7 feet while maintaining the two bedrooms at the same dimensions.<br>- At the top floor, we would suggest pulling the master bedroom suite forward or south on the property so that it still maintains the design review guideline recommended 9 foot setback from the street.<br>- He is available for questions on the alternative proposal.<br>(-) Stan Padilla<br>- He and his wife live near the proposed construction.<br>- One of the issues important to him is that there has usually been a neighborhood spirit of inclusion and involvement that didn't happen here.<br>- He is concerned that the neighbors did not get an opportunity to discuss issues related to the proposed construction.<br>- He is also concerned that this project is not to benefit a family who will live there; this is a developer who will expand on this site (and leave).<br>- He is impacted by the size of this project.<br>(-) Jed Davies<br>- He lives on Douglass Street.<br>- They moved to this house because of the character of the neighborhood.<br>- This proposed extension of 25 feet is inappropriate and unfair.  It goes all the way across his property.<br>- This project will encase his property.<br>- He is only asking the Commission to direct the project sponsor to reduce the rear extension and reduce the third story roof.<br>(-) Vicky Rosen &ndash; President of Upper Noe Neighbors<br>- She does not live near the proposed project yet she is concerned with the huge homes that are being built near smaller homes.<br>- It is really important to do the right thing and scale down the project a little bit.<br>(+) John Hood &ndash; Project Architect &ndash; Hood Architects<br>- This project is in keeping with the general fabric of the neighborhood.<br>- His design is to mass the building towards the middle of the house in order to minimize the impact on the rear and from the front.<br>- Setting back the third floor from the street is meeting the guideline of maintaining scale from pedestrian level.<br>- He would like to have this project approved with recommendations from staff by reducing the height of the gable by 4 feet.<br>(+) Randy Cooper<br>- He has lived in this neighborhood for many years.<br>- He is not a developer.<br>- He has fixed up 5 homes in this neighborhood over a 15 year period and has lived in the homes over a period of 3 years each.<br>- His design will be compatible with the neighborhood.<br>- He is currently in a rental home.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take Discretionary Review and approve with modifications based on the recommendations offered by the DR requestor&rsquo;s architect.
