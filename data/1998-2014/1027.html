    <ul><ul><p>6. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

    <p>- This week he had a letter published in the Chronicle about good editorial in that paper.  This letter was a personal one and did not reflect the Planning Commission as a whole.</p>

    <p>- He did receive various letters on the Housing Element and will be responding to these letters with his comments.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

    <p>- The Planning Commission receives an enormous amount of correspondence and she reads every single piece of correspondence she receives so she requested that correspondence be submitted to them early on.</p>

    <p>- The Planning Commission has made various requests to staff and she would like to have a means of keeping track of these requests.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commission Secretary:</font></p>

    <p>- She responded to Commissioner Feldstein's requests as follows:  </p>

    <p><i>Re:  Correspondence</i></p>

    <p>- She has made it a policy that if the public gets correspondence to her eight days prior to the hearing, then the Commission will receive it a week in advance.  If the public does not meet the deadline, then the Commission will receive it late as well.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Action List</i></p>

    <p>- She keeps an action list of all requests made by Commissioners.  This list is distributed to the Director, Zoning Administrator and management staff so they can respond to those requests.  She will make this document available to Commissioner Feldstein.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

    <p>- He believes that there is not enough information from the Redevelopment Agency and how they will rezone certain areas.  This ties into the Transbay Terminal, Supervisor Peskin's proposal for Secondary Units, and the whole Eastern Neighborhood/South of Market areas. </p>

    <p>- He would like overlays to show what is the impact of the new proposed housing element; another overlay regarding the Eastern plans south of Market and Bay View Hunters Point; and other overlays from the Mayor's Office of Housing, Redevelopment Agency and Transportation Authority.</p>

</ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>7. Director's Announcements</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Budget</i></p>

    <p>- On June 11, 2003 the budget process begins.  Unfortunately, he is unable at present to give any information about it to the Commission.</p>

    <p>- He will give a presentation on June 12, 2003, and include what came out of the Budget Committee.</p>

    <p>8. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOS - </font></p>

    <p>- There was no action taken on Planning matters at the Board of Supervisors during the last two weeks, as neither the full Board nor the Land Use Committee has met since the week of May 19, 2003.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Appeals to be heard or filed at the Board of Supervisors:</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Tuesday, June 10, 2003:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  2690 Harrison Street</i></p>

    <p>- The Conditional Use Appeal of the 54-unit residential project at 2690 Harrison Street will be considered.</p>

    <p>- June 10, 2003 is the final day that the Board can take action on the appeal of the Planning Commission made on March 20, 2003, which had a vote of +6-1 (Commissioner Feldstein voted No).  The matter was heard before the Board of Supervisors on May 13, 2003, but then action was continued until this coming Tuesday when a member of the Board requested that a mediation session take lace between the appellants and the project sponsor.  Planning staff is currently looking at the plans that were approved.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  J-10 Wharf Project</i></p>

    <p>- Fish processing tenants of this pier have filed an appeal of the statutory exemptions from CEQA review for the emergency demolition that was issued on April 15, 2003.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  O'Shaugnessy Dam Negative Declaration Appeal</i></p>

    <p>- The appeal has been filed by the group Restore Hetch Hetchy and the Sierra Club.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Board of Supervisors Hearing of June 17, 2003</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Secondary Units Environmental Exemption Appeal</i></p>

    <p>- The Planning Department's environmental review exemption to the secondary unit legislation has been appealed by two groups:  The Coalition to Protect our Neighborhoods and the Coalition for San Francisco Neighborhoods.</p>

    <p>- Assuming that the Board upholds the Department's exemption on June 17, 2003, the Secondary Unit ordinance is to be considered by the Planning Commission on June 26, 2003 when the Commission will have the opportunity to make a recommendation to the Board on the merits of the ordinance.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  1017 Ocean Avenue</i></p>

    <p>- A Conditional Use appeal was filed by 20 percent of the surrounding property owners for this project to install three wireless antennas on this three story, multi-use structure as part of Verizon's wireless network.  The site is located in an NC-2 District.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Board of Supervisors Hearing of June 24, 2003</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  40-50 Lansing Street</i></p>

    <p>- This is a Conditional Use appeal of an 82-unit residential project filed by five members of the Board of Supervisors (Daly, Ammiano, Gonzales, Sandoval and Maxwell).  </p>

    <p><i>Re:  3725 Buchanan Street</i></p>

    <p>- This is a Conditional Use appeal to authorize 8 antennas.  The Planning Commission heard this item on May 1, 2003.  About 20% of the surrounding property owners filed the appeal.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Board of Supervisor's Hearing of July 8, 2003:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  948-950 Lombard Street</i></p>

    <p>- This is an appeal of the Planning Department's Categorical Exemption from environmental reviews.  This Willis Polk Historic house is to be moved by 10' on the lot with a rear yard addition.  It has received eight Discretionary Review requests from surrounding neighbors.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOA:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  2651 Lombard Street - Billboard</i></p>

    <p>- This case was not before the Commission, but it is an interesting case.</p>

    <p>- There was a billboard on the site owned by a major billboard company.  The company decided to remove the billboard after not being able to come to an agreement with the owner on the current rent.  </p>

    <p>- The property owner wanted to put a billboard.  Proposition G forbids new billboards.</p>

    <p>- The Zoning Administrator ruled that a mere replacement was not a <i>new</i> billboard.</p>

    <p>- The question was:  &quot;who has the right to own the billboard?&quot;</p>

    <p>- The billboard companies thought that they owned the billboard since they own the structure that the billboard goes on.  The owner thought that they had the right to own the billboard because land uses run with the land and not with the ownership.</p>

    <p>- The Zoning Administrator was upheld +4-1.</p>

    <p>- The Zoning Administrator felt that the use ran with the property and that the property owner has the right.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

    <p><i>RE: Zoning Administrator's report:</i></p>

    <p>- Many of the billboard companies do not want to pay $400.00 a month, they can only pay $200.00 a month.</p>

    <p>- The question is &quot;who owns the billboards?&quot;  She believes that the Conditional Use goes with the life of the property not who the tenant is.</p>

    <p>- There are no enforcement fees.</p>

    <p>- The biggest problem in the Planning Department is that there is a lack of enforcement.</p>

    <p>- Senior Citizens own a lot of property in San Francisco but they cannot afford to pay Discretionary Review fees.</p>

    <p>- Many of the neighborhood activists seem to be taking on the task of enforcement instead of the Planning Department.</p>

    <p>- He is concerned with Discretionary Review fees and building permit fees.</p>

    <p>- There are legal problems with establishing nexus fees and Discretionary Review fees.</p>

    <p>- If the DR fees are increased, there will be less and less frivolous cases.</p>

    <p>- What kinds of benefits accrue?  Community benefits or individual benefits?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- Developers are not being impacted directly; it is the consumer.</p>

    <p>- One of the things that the Commission should be taking into consideration is the incredible cost that the Board of Supervisors has imposed on the Commission without any cost benefit to the Commission or any cost reimbursement.</p>

    <p>- The Board of Supervisors have become a defacto Planning Commission.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Maria Souza</font></p>

    <p>- She is concerned with the increase of Discretionary Review fees because many of the residents of the Richmond District have fixed incomes.</p>

    <p>- She suggested that if a DR project prevails, they should be the ones to carry out the fees.</p>

    <p>- If fees will be increased, this will create an incentive to approve those project and those issues.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">(-) Marilyn Amini</font></p>

    <p>- She is concerned about Discretionary Reviews.</p>

    <p>- It is unfair for people who cannot afford to pay the increase in fees.</p>

Proposed revisions will update and amend the <i>Residence Element</i> adopted in 1990 and include an assessment of housing needs, new policies to increase housing production such as higher residential densities along appropriate transit corridors and downtown neighborhoods; encouragement of housing development in neighborhood commercial districts; reconsideration of residential parking requirements; and policies supporting construction of new family housing.   <i>The Housing Element Final Draft for Public Review</i> incorporated modifications based on comments and other feedback received by the Planning Department on the first draft published in August 2002.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Continuance</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Marilyn Amini</font></p>

    <p>- She believes that this case should be continued because this item was advertised to be hard in the Board of Supervisor's Chambers.</p>

    <p>- There are a lot of graduations today and people might not be able to come to the hearing.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Merits of Case</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">George Williams - SPUR</font></p>

    <p>- SPUR has been working with the Planning Department to approve policies that meet the needs of the City of San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- SPUR supports the final draft of the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- SPUR requests that the Planning Commission approve the housing element and the rezoning efforts.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Susan Vaughn</font></p>

    <p>- She is representing Transportation for a Livable City.</p>

    <p>- She is in support of the Housing Element because there is a lot in this document that provide solutions to problems and issues facing the City.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patricia Vaughey</font></p>

    <p>- Before the Planning Commission passes this Housing Element it should be changed back to what it was.</p>

    <p>- The affordable housing issue should be straightened out.</p>

    <p>- It is important to look at what the City is doing and what the City is doing wrong and then start correcting and implementing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Penelope Clark</font></p>

    <p>- She lives on Russian Hill.</p>

    <p>- Sites with heavy density and no parking already exist throughout the City.</p>

    <p>- People have lives outside of what public transportation can provide.</p>

    <p>- Providing parking more efficiently is a very important issue.</p>

    <p>- If this is not looked at it will seriously damage the quality of life in San Francisco.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Pat Devlieg</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in the Excelsior District.  She uses public transportation a lot.</p>

    <p>- The density in this district is increasing without having more developments.</p>

    <p>- She feels that people are stuck in a &quot;parking hell.&quot;</p>

    <p>- For neighborhoods to restrict the amount of parking and construct developments without parking will be damaging to the City.</p>

    <p>- There should be some accommodation for affordable housing but the proposal is too dense.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ernestine Weiss</font></p>

    <p>- She has been preaching about affordable housing for a long time.</p>

    <p>- She suggests building housing along the transit corridors.</p>

    <p>- She feels that this can be done.</p>

    <p>- This City will be a ghost town if all this planning is not implemented soon.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

    <p>- If this Housing Element is implemented it will be a disaster.</p>

    <p>- Where are the subsidies going to come out of?</p>

    <p>- It is important to calculate formulas and not set projections on hopes and ideas.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Grace Kiely</font></p>

    <p>- She feels that there are flaws in the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- No research has been done on where people that have left the City have moved.</p>

    <p>- She believes that these people have purchased homes in other cities of the Bay Area.</p>

    <p>- When people purchase homes it provides taxes and these taxes provide money for services.</p>

    <p>- This document needs to be looked at more closely.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Richie Hart</font></p>

    <p>- He is quite confused with this document because there is no consistency within the tables and charts.</p>

    <p>- It seems as if San Francisco is &quot;anti business.&quot;</p>

    <p>- It is important to let private developers build affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Shawn Gorman</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in Potrero Hill and has been involved in housing issues for many years.</p>

    <p>- It is important to change the policies as well as televising the hearings because it is a way to educate people.</p>

    <p>- Three bedroom units can be built in this city.  The problem is that most of the areas don't allow it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Archie Occhipinki</font></p>

    <p>- He has been involved in housing in San Francisco for many, many years.</p>

    <p>- It is important to go back to density and not provide so much parking.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Redmond Lyons</font></p>

    <p>- This policy and objective has failed for about 30 years.</p>

    <p>- He would like to see more than what is in this document.  He would like to have a system in place where a developer wants to build something; goes through the proper procedures and within 9 months they should be able to start construction.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Dave O'Keefe</font></p>

    <p>- He is a small builder in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- It is pretty clear that the policies in the past that were implemented did not work, otherwise this item would not be before the Commission.</p>

    <p>- Making only eight major changes to the old policies as the way to &quot;fix what is broken here&quot; is really a &quot;pipe&quot; dream.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Araceli Lara</font></p>

    <p>- She works for Mission Agenda.</p>

    <p>- She is concerned that the Commissioners should think about affordable housing and that this document should be implemented.</p>

    <p>- It is urgent that affordable housing be implemented because there are a lot of people that live in difficult situations.</p>

    <p>- It is important to include housing for families in this Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jan (did not state last name)</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in a hotel in the Mission.</p>

    <p>- She would like the Commission to support the Housing Element.  She moved here from Hawaii and has been living in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- This Housing Element addresses the needs of family housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Miriam Munoz - St. Peter's Housing Committee</font></p>

    <p>- She is a mother with four children.</p>

    <p>- Landlords take advantage of low-income families.</p>

    <p>- She lives in a place where there are cockroaches and rats.</p>

    <p>- Tenants are afraid to complain because landlords have very good lawyers.</p>

    <p>- Pass the Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Libby Benedict</font></p>

    <p>- She is a homeowner in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- She is speaking on behalf of the Francisco Heights Residents Association.</p>

    <p>- The proposed document ignores parking and transit inadequacies and does harm to existing neighborhood character.</p>

    <p>- Her organization was not invited to participate in the process of this document.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Barbara Austin</font></p>

    <p>- She is a native San Franciscan.</p>

    <p>- What concerns her is that neighborhoods were involved in discussing housing issues, but with this document many neighborhood associations were not involved.</p>

    <p>- This document is going to affect a lot of people for a long time.</p>

    <p>- She feels that there will be no rent control if secondary units are legalized.</p>

    <p>- Perhaps legalizing secondary units would be allowed only in certain districts.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Greg Hylton</font></p>

    <p>- This document is social engineering.</p>

    <p>- He has no problem with low-income housing in San Francisco, but the Housing Element is not the solution.</p>

    <p>- You are creating transit corridors that do not have any definition.</p>

    <p>-This document will create opportunities for people to take advantage.</p>

    <p>- Many jobs have been lost in San Francisco because many large companies have moved out and are not coming back.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Beatrice Laws</font></p>

    <p>- She has lived in San Francisco since 1953.</p>

    <p>- She was startled that this document was before the Planning Commission today since she only found out about it two days ago.</p>

    <p>- She asks that the Commission direct the Department to give further notice so more people will be notified.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Rosalind Orcutt - Mission Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in an SRO Hotel.</p>

    <p>- If it weren't for Mission Agenda she would not be here.</p>

    <p>- She has been able to receive assistance from them.</p>

    <p>- There is no affordable housing in the Mission District and it is very much needed.</p>

    <p>- She is happy to know that the Commission is looking at this document that will affect the City for the next 10 years or so, and hopes they will adopt it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Julius Countryman - Mission Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- He moved away from San Francisco many years ago but he has moved back.</p>

    <p>- He is currently homeless.  It is important to have affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Adopt the Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Maria Sousa</font></p>

    <p>- She grew up in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- She feels that this draft is not ready to be approved until certain amendments are done.</p>

    <p>- It is not correct to work on a document internally and then present it to the public as if being complete.</p>

    <p>- Having meetings with eight neighborhoods is not sufficient.  The Department should meet with all neighborhoods.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ron Miguel</font></p>

    <p>- His neighborhood was never contacted to participate in the development of this document.</p>

    <p>- If this document is passed the way it is, the Commission will have hearings until midnight.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Aurora Grajeda - Mission Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- The Mission District is a very wonderful neighborhood.</p>

    <p>- If the Commission does not do something about affordable housing, this will be damaging to the City.</p>

    <p>- She understands that there is no perfect plan but this document has a lot of problems.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Kate White - Housing Coalition</font></p>

    <p>- She is here to urge the Commission to support the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- It is important to have affordable housing for immigrants.</p>

    <p>- There are a lot of items that the coalition supports like secondary units, etc.</p>

    <p>- This is just a policy guideline document and she realizes that there is still a lot of work to get these items implemented.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jay Bradshaw - Carpenter's Union</font></p>

    <p>- The Carpenter's Union totally supports the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- The union supports anything that allows affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- The union also supports subsidized housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Lupo - Carpenter's Union</font></p>

    <p>- He submitted a binder with a letter from the Executive Director of the Union and with various examples of projects that were constructed by cutting corners.  Cutting corners could be dangerous to the people living there.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Timothy Tittle - Mission Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in a place that is infested with cockroaches and rats.</p>

    <p>- It is important to take seniors and affordable housing into consideration.</p>

    <p>- Adopt the Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Lopez</font></p>

    <p>- Affordable housing is really important in San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- The problem is not out there on the streets.  The problem is within the offices where decisions are made.</p>

    <p>- He hopes that money hasn't dulled hearing or hardened harts.</p>

    <p>- The Housing Element should be passed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Meagan Sullivan</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in the Richmond.</p>

    <p>- She would like to oppose the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- She does not support increasing density in transit corridors.</p>

    <p>- The final draft is not realistic in regards to parking and traffic.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Hiroshi Fukuda</font></p>

    <p>- The Housing Element is a blueprint to converting San Francisco to a real City.</p>

    <p>- He feels that San Francisco is a real City and it is a great place to live.</p>

    <p>- Families have left San Francisco because there is no affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- He believes that the new housing element will continue this pattern.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mike DeCastro</font></p>

</ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">F. PUBLIC COMMENT</font></p>

  <ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. </p>

  <p>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>

  <p>(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or</p>

  <p>(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or </p>

  <p>(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))</p>

  <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

  <p><i>Re:  Items on the Calendars</i></p>

  <p>- The Continuation of the Major Alteration Legislation has been dropped off the July 17, 2003 calendar.</p>

  <p>- It is important to have a single hearing date on the Residential Design Guidelines' second hearing and the Demolition Policy's second hearing.</p>

  <p>- It is difficult to do demolition policy, residential design guidelines and alternations without having heard this all together.</p>

  <p><font class="heading2">Judy Berkowitz</font></p>

  <p><i>Re:  SFGTV Broadcasting</i></p>

  <p>- Most of the Commissioners have received faxes regarding broadcasting on the web and on television.</p>

  <p>- Starting July 1, 2003, this will actually happen.</p>

  <p>- She would like to ask the Commission to request SFGTV to have audio restored on the archives.</p>

  <p><font class="heading2">John Bardis</font></p>

  <p><i>Re:  Correspondence on the City's economy</i></p>

  <p>- He would like to know what is the Commissioner's understanding regarding the economic engine that drives the City's economy and what are the most significant industries that make up the City's economy.</p>

  <p>- He will be submitting correspondence regarding this and hopes that he might be able to get some answers from the Commission.</p>
