  <p><span>                        </span>She would like to know, either by the 
    City Attorney or the Director, if all the Commissioners were to be invited 
    to a meeting or an event, even if all of them were to attend just as observers, 
    would that require the event to be noticed?</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>The City Attorney, after checking the 
    laws of the Sunshine Ordinance, stated that the event does require it to be 
    noticed.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span><i>Re: Live/Work Lofts Enforcement</i></p>
  <p><span>                        </span>She would like to know how many cases 
    we have gone in and looked at.  How are these cases being enforced or chosen?</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>The Zoning Administrator replied that 
    we send out about 25 to 30 notices of violation of live/work units alleged 
    being used for all office use.  These notices may have covered more than one 
    live/work unit.  Somewhere in that range many were abated, others proved that 
    they weren't in violation, others when to the Board of Appeals.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>The cases are being chosen usually on 
    a complaint basis or when it's brought to the ZA's attention.  There was one 
    mentioned in the SF Weekly that the Bay Guardian has occupied a unit contrary 
    to the intent of the live/work ordinance.</p>

    there was some concern that the Department monitor these antennas.  The matter 
    was continued for another two weeks.  The Public Hearing on this matter was 
    closed.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span><i>Re:  Appeal of the Planned unit Development

  <p><span>                        </span>- The project was revised after it came 
    before the Commission.  It originally had 43 units with 6 units of affordable 
    housing.  It was revised to have 39 units with 5 units of affordable housing. 
    The Board, after hearing public testimony, approved the project.</p>

    Department accomplished their goal.  Although, the Department did not come 
    out as we originally wanted, the decision was favorable.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>- There will be an administrative analysis 
    that will be the liaison for the Department to the Board of Supervisors.  
    This position was approved.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>- Supervisor McGoldrick did not pressure 
    us regarding IPZ areas.  He believes that January would be a target date to 
    start the environmental review.</p>
  <p><span>                        </span>- The Board approved $263 thousand that 
    will go to the department to purchase new equipment (e.g. computers, and a 
    new vehicle for enforcement, etc).  One year from now, this position will 
    have to prove that it has been effective.  In January, the department will 
    come back to the Board to ask to release the other funds.</p>

  <p>- At the recommendation of the Zoning Administration, the City Attorney suggests 
    a recommendation of an amendment to section 155(j).  Section 155(j) states 
    that except as provided in 155.1 and 155.2 for each 20 off street parking 
    space provided, 1 space should be provided for parking of bicycles.  The most 
    restricted provision of 155(j) or 155.4 shall prevail.  This would have the 
    effect of ensuring that this currently existing ratio of off street parking 
    to bike parking would only come into play when the requirements of 155.4 were 
    less restrictive.</p>

  <p>- Mr. Badiner explained perfectly what the intent is.  The existing bicycle 
    storage legislation is strictly limited to commercial buildings that have 
    parking space and they wanted to create a bicycle storage requirement for 
    other commercial buildings.</p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- Bicycle transit is a very environmentally 
    friendly form of transportation that they really would like to encourage.

  <p><span

  <p>- The project sponsor would like to have the Commission approve the project 
    as proposed then the sponsor would allow 2 affordable units.  The second proposal 
    would be that the design of the project change with the top floor set back.  
    The second option would not allow for owner occupancy.</p>

  <p><span

    is a negative affect on the PDR's within the area.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- Although the catering component 
    of the project is a positive one since it will provide jobs to the neighborhood,

    very large restaurant.</span></p>

  <p>- Although they are in favor of the catering component because if fits into 
    the blue collar uses that are in the North East Mission Industrial Zone.  
    These types of catering jobs provide good living wages and provide jobs for

  <p>- One issue seems to be unresolved:  nobody really knows what affordable 
    is.  This is certainly subjective since who you are determines what is affordable 
    for you.</p>
  <p>- The appetizers will be in the $3.00 to $9.00 range.  Entrees will begin 
    around $10.00 and range up to about $18.00.</p>
  <p>- Regarding employment practices:  they will employee equally from the back 
    kitchen staff into the management staff.  They have always promoted and maintained 
    diversity in their working environment.  As far as specific agreements of 
    hiring within the community, they are certainly open to discussions with the 
    community.  There are certain jobs that will have certain requirements and 
    these requirements will have to be met.  If they are found within the community, 
    well, that would be great.</p>

    program proposed by the project sponsor.</span></p>
  <p><span

  <p><b><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- </span></b><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>He agrees and appreciates the Planning 
    Department's recommendation of removing the top floor, however, the issue 
    of rear depth and the impacts on the rear depth of the proposed structure 
    has not been addressed by the recommendation.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- He does not believe that a variance 
    is required but he leaves that to the discretion of the department.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- The staff analysis recognizes that 
    the proposed 4<sup>th</sup> story building does not step down in height in 
    the rear of the lot, which leads to an incompatible building rear configuration.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- Changing the pattern of the rear 
    yards would have a significant negative impact on the mid block open space.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- Each of the adjacent buildings has 
    side windows, which accommodate light, and air and this project will negatively 
    impact these windows.</span></p>
  <p>- In addition to the removal of the 4<sup>th</sup> floor, he would like to 
    have the building built at it's existing zero setback.  He believes that this 
    would be consistent with the neighborhood.</p>

    neighbor to show their perspective of the impact they will have if this project 
    is constructed.</span></p>
  <p>- The character of Roosevelt Way is that it's a sloping hill. Each roofline 
    continues up the hill.  This 4-story building would interrupt that.</p>

  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- She realizes how difficult it is 
    to have different needs and different wants.</span></p>
  <p>- The project is of a very large scale.  She agrees with the staff recommendation 
    to bring down the size of the building.</p>
  <p><b><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>(-) Ed Knoll</span></b></p>
  <p>- He supports the zero setbacks and the elimination of the 4<sup>th</sup>

  <p>- She lives across the street from the proposed project.  </p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- She also agrees with everything 
    the previous speakers have stated.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- The 4<sup>th</sup> Floor should 
    be eliminated.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- She has no problems with the frontage.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- If the 4<sup>th</sup> story were 
    allowed to be built, it would lower the value of the other homes.</span></p>

    and he is speaking on behalf of the tenants of this building.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- One concern is the tree that will 
    be removed because of the construction.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- There are a few trees that are mature 
    and add greatly to the neighborhood not only in appearance but also enhance 
    the privacy of the homes</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- He would like a condition to have 
    the tree remain or replaced with a tree of similar shape.</span></p>

    a unit in a building on this street.</span></p>

    rented the unit because of the view but she could now be cheated of this.</p>

  <p>- There is a cluster of back yards that provide open space.  If there is 
    no setback it will not impact these yards.</p>

  <p>- As a result of accommodating the Department's decision with concerns to 
    the front setback, it forced the architect to design the project vertically.  
    That is why the 4<sup>th</sup> floor was designed into this project.</p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- The massing has been mitigated by 
    the graduated front setbacks on each level above the garage.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- There is an established pattern 
    for the rooflines and that pattern is consistent.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- The owners of the property share 
    a home office and telecommute so the 4<sup>th</sup> floor is quite important 
    for this family.</span></p>
  <p><span
style=&rsquo;font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;&rsquo;>- The project will not obstruct the 
    views of the neighbors.</span></p>
  <p><b>ACTION:           Take DR and eliminate 4<sup>th</sup> floor.  Sponsor
