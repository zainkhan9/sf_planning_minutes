</div>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">Re: Transportation Authority. Is the Planning Department and the Transportation Authority coordinating all transportation and land use projects? Secondly, Does the Transportation Authority use the sales tax funds for work on the Transportation Management Account, the Transportation Demand Management Program, and the Transit [Preferential] Streets Program. It is his understanding that the Transportation Authority has not provided, or will provide, any funding to the Planning Department next year. This is of great concern to him. He is requesting that the Executive Director of the Transportation Authority to come to the Planning Commission and explain to them what his plans are regarding this funding</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">Re: Harvey Rose Audit and Supervisor McGoldrick's requirement to have an advisory board oversee the implementation of it. His proposal is to have one or two commissioners work with the Planning Department and provide, through the Commissioners, to the chair of the Land Use Committee the status and cost of implementing those proposals. Requested that this be calendared next week to appoint one or two commissioners to the committee.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">Re: Housing. Requested presentations from different City agencies to ensure the better coordination of what we are doing with other City agencies and to ensure that there is available funding next year--given our budget deficit. First, from the Landmarks Board he would like the Executive Director present to the Planning Commission an overview of their roles and responsibilities. Second, he requested a presentation from the Mayor's Office of Housing. Of the five major projects that are being reviewed now, where are they in the EIR process? But more importantly, are they paying the Planning Department for this work?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">He has requested that the Director of the Redevelopment Agency come before the Commission because they have cut out some projects; like the Mid-Market EIR for next year-at least I didn't see it in the budget that was presented to us. He wants them to tell us what their priorities are and what they are paying the Planning Department next year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">He would also like the Mayor's Office of Economic Development come and tell us what their priorities are. What funding they are providing to the community and how that ties into the planning process and the Planning Department's bottom line.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">Finally, it would be appropriate to have the Muni Director here to present and educate us on their 5 or 10 year plan, and find out what funding sources they have for the planning staff to work on some of their projects.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">The Guidelines that exist today in San Francisco are some of the most comprehensive in the entire state...--the western United States for that matter.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">We have worked very diligently with Planning staff in the past to come up with some reasonable changes to these guidelines.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">We do actively update our information on the Five Year Plan for the City every six months. Sometimes, when the necessity of site comes up, we can only predict out our build plan based on budget constraints, changes in the economy, customer's complaints, service problems, etc. Our updates to the Five Year Plan are generated from this information-the areas that we need to improve by adding additional sites etc.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">Urged the Commission to take three actions: 1) Reject the Planning Department's recommendations with respect to necessity, site compliance and coverage maps; 2) Follow the lead of President Bradford Bell at the 12/10/02 Wireless hearing and Supervisor Ammiano at the Board meeting on 2/20/03 and instruct the Planning Department to make revisions of the guidelines a priority in its 2003 Work Program Budget and propose industry fees to fund this process; and 3) Insure that the process that began over two years ago when Snafu invited members of the industry to attend their meeting with Mayor Brown on this issue, continue in a fair, reasonable, timely and comprehensive manner.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">(-) Libby Kelly, Council on Wireless Technology Impacts</font></b></p>

<p><b><font face="Arial">(-) Frieda Humboldt</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">It is very important that the City start implementing/enforcing its own code permit violations and non-compliance cases.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">-</font> <font face="Arial">The City would enforce permit violations when small business owners make them, but when wireless breaks the rules, little or nothing is done about it.</font></p>
