<p>C. <u>COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS</u>
<p>	<strong><u>Chinchilla</u>:	The Commissioner's Action List is not complete.  Items
mentioned after a SPUR meeting on zoning for more housing
that he wanted staff to take a look at were not included. There
was also another item he believes should be on the list--he will
check his notes to identify and confirm.  Directed Commission
Secretary to take a look at this for the next meeting.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Theoharis</u>:	Thanked Mr. PASSMORE for supplying the Commission with
the requested reduced transit maps.</strong>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	7.	Consideration of adoption -- draft minutes of 6/18/98, 6/25/98, 7/9/98,
7/16/98.<strong>ACTION: Approved as amended/corrected: <u>6/18/98:</u> #5, under ACTION,
General--should not be included, does not believe that that condition was
imposed at that hearing; <u>6/25/98</u>: correct spelling of name at beginning of
document -- THE MEETING WAS CALLED TO ORDER BY PRESIDENT CHINCHILLA AT
1:37 P.M.,</strong>
<p><strong>	- correct #5 &amp; 6 as follows: <u>DIRECTOR'S ANNOUNCEMENTS</u></strong>
<p><strong><u>	</u>		Budget outcome at BOS Finance Committee to this point: The
Committee recommended that the Department be allowed to keep its
funding--they at least instructed  the Budget Analyst (Mr. Harvey
Rose) to meet the Department half way.  Original proposal was
$8,877,368. The Board approved $8,688,187 -- 20% over last year (or
current fiscal year budget).  This means a slight increase in fees and
an approximate $284,000 additional General Fund increase, allowing
the Department to fill four new positions -- 2 in Environmental Review
and 2 in Neighborhood Planning.</strong>
<p>	<strong>	6.	REVIEW OF PAST WEEK'S EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS &amp; 
BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</strong>
<p><strong>			BOS:	Mt. Sutro: The Board considered whether they would do
anything about the structural requirements for the Tower then
decided not to act on it, did not require it.  However, the Mt.
Sutro Corp. has decided that they will go forward with an
analysis of the Tower.</strong>
<p><strong> 	- correct #8 as follows:  97.678, ACTION: Meeting held. No action required at 		this time.	<strike>AYES: Chinchilla, Theoharis, Mills, Hills, Martin,</strike> </strong>
<p><strong>				<strike>ABSENT: Antenore, Joe</strike></strong>	
<p><strong>	- correct #13 as follows:  ACTION: Approved with conditions as modified:</strong>
<p><strong>		Condition #7.   The Project Sponsor shall be responsible for ensuring that
<strike>street sidewalk</strike> steamed cleaners clean the area in front the 3600-16th
Street at least once per month.;</strong>
<p><strong> <u>7/16/98</u>:   under </strong>C. <u>COMMISSIONERS' QUESTIONS AND MATTERS</u>
<p><strong>- Chinchilla: Update "Action" list</strong>
<p><strong>- Mills: Recently attended meeting where focus was Transit First Policy.  After
adopting this policy we never carried out a land use policy that reinforced it.  The
Department had some maps that showed the routes of the transit lines so you
could see which were most heavily served by transit.  Request that a couple of
those maps be available at CPC hearings so when certain projects come up we
can pinpoint location and see how they relate to what this framework was
suppose to be about.; </strong>
<p><strong>#3, 	BOS: Housing and Neighborhood Services Committee</strong>
<p><strong>           - Special Historic Sign Legislation - continued to <strike>rest</strike> next hearing</strong>

<p>D. <u>	DIRECTOR'S REPORT</u>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>	8.  <u>DIRECTOR'S ANNOUNCEMENTS</u>
<p>		<strong>- Attended DPW Quality of Life Forum last night--it was announced that a
small business forum at the Westin Hotel on 8/16 will be held--feels there
will be a great need for planning participation--members of the
Commission might want to attend.</strong>
<p><strong>		- On 7/27, the Board of Supervisors overturned the Commission action on
the Rite Aide proposal at 1200 9th Avenue by a vote of +11 -0.</strong>
<p><strong>		- Hello to Mary Gallagher (currently out on maternity leave--but in the
audience today) and her new daughter Megan.</strong>

<p>	9.<u>	REVIEW OF PAST WEEK'S EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS &amp;  		BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</u>
<p>	<strong>BOS:	Housing &amp; Neighborhood Services Committee reviewed the
Historic Sign District &amp; Message Establishment legislation for
the North of Market Special Use District and the Public Arts
Historic Landmarks legislation -- recommend approval of all 3
and forwarded to full Board.</strong>
<p><strong>	BOA: 	- 723 De Hama St--proposal to replace 4 illegal housing units
in a commercial bldg. with a live/work project--Commission
felt it was inappropriate displacement of housing.  However
the Board felt it was an appropriate use of the site and over
ruled the Commission +3 -0.</strong>
<p><strong>	- Quotas for various types of commercial uses/whether we had any guidelines:
with the exception of those uses that are eating and drinking establishments
where there are guidelines in the neighborhood commercial section of the
Commerce and Industry Element, and those few uses that have the distance
between criteria that you have to use, such as massage parlors, adult
entertainment, and other types of entertainment in neighborhood commercial
districts, we don't have anything in guidelines.  We will be doing a
neighborhood commercial study at some point in time and that question
would be appropriate to look at at that time.</strong>
<p><strong>	- Hans Habachi on Castro Street - Smog Hog was put in place.  For a while we
thought it was successful, but recently we are getting complaints from
neighbors about odor problems.  We are in contact with the maintenance
people to make sure it is being maintained properly.  I (PASSMORE) will be
going out to investigate.  Will keep you alerted with what happens with Hans
Habachi and if necessary will bring the matter back before the commission.</strong>
<p>	<strong>- Because other neighborhoods thought we were successful with Hans
Habachi, we are getting complaints from other areas about other
neighborhood restaurants generating odors with the hope that we would be
able to take care of their concerns.</strong>

<p>		<u>BICYCLE TRANSIT ENHANCEMENT PLAN</u>, Consideration of a proposal to
amend the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to
clarify definition of and obligations of the responsible City official and the
landlord regarding the provision of bicycle facilities in or for building space
leased to the City and deleting obsolete implementation schedule provisions. 
The amendment would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to
require shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and
buildings undergoing major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already
requires bicycle spaces in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is
no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3
(Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be
required by this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential
buildings and buildings primarily used as parking garages.

<p>	 	<u>NEWS RACK ADVERTISING EXEMPTION PLANNING CODE AMENDMENT</u> -
Consideration of a proposal to amend the Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by
amending Section 603 to exempt advertising on fixed pedestal news racks in
accordance with Section 184.12 of the Public Works Code from Planning Code
requirements regulating signs.  The recently-enacted Section 184.12 of the
Public Works Code governs size of ads that can be placed on news racks.  The
proposed Planning Code amendment would remove any discrepancy between
the Public Works Code and the Planning Code regarding such ads.  The ability
to  place ads on the pedestal units would provide an incentive for a private
vendor to contract with Department of Public Works (DPW) for the placement
and maintenance of this news rack design which would be the only news racks
allowed in designated news rack zones.

<p>	15.	98.447EZ	 (ROSETTER)
<p>		<u>3100 WEBSTER STREET</u> Consideration of a proposal to amend the zoning
map for the property at 3100 Webster Street, being Lot 12, Assessor's Block
508 (one lot in the block bounded by Webster, Moulton, Buchanan and
Greenwich Streets) from an RH-2 (Two Family Residential) District to an NC-3
(Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial District.  The proposed amendment
would allow the existing Del Sol Motel  (formerly the Plantation Inn) to remain. 
Since the property was reclassified from R-3 (Multi-Family Residential) to RH-2
in 1978, a motel on this property has been a non-conforming use with a
mandate to conform in twenty years (1998).  Conforming to the RH-2 District
would require that the motel be converted to residential use.  Since hotels are a
conditional use in the NC-3 District, the reclassification would allow the motel to
continue with any expansion or intensification as a hotel requiring a conditional
use authorization from the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
may also consider recommending reclassification to an NC-2 (Small Scale
Neighborhood Commercial District) as an alternative.

Lot 2 in Assessor's Block 1019 in an  RM-1 (Residential, Mixed Low-Density)

SOUGHT:</strong> The proposal is to construct a two-story-over-garage addition at the
front of the lot and connect it to the existing legal non-conforming, single-family
dwelling at the rear of the subject lot via a ground level corridor.  The bulk of the
expansion will be at the front of the lot and is code-complying.  However, a
portion of the proposed one-story, ground-level, 13'-9" by 20'-0" corridor
connecting the existing house with the bulk of the proposed addition would be
located in the required rear yard, and would therefore require a rear yard
variance.

<p>	<strong><u>Mills</u>: Congratulate our Director.  Mr. Green has been appointed to the
Executive Committee of ABAG.  Also in October, he will be given the Outstanding
Achievement Award at Cal Poly from the School of City and Regional Planning.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Antenore</u>:</strong> <strong>Appeals of CPC decisions and how our decisions get
communicated to the body appealed to is important and we need to have further
discussion of this in some appropriate manner.  Request that we consider some
form of discussing it in greater depth and how we are going to make sure that our
decisions and the reasons behind them are getting adequately communicated.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Chinchilla</u>: Directed that Mr. Green and Mr. PASSMORE get together and
consider that and report back under Director's Report as to what the current
procedures are, what the Department's historical participation in that process has
been and whether there is any room for change or whether we need to calendar it
for discussion and policy implementation by the Commission.   </strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Green</u>: Question for clarity: Are you asking for a discussion about the normal
procedure on how your items get presented to the Board?  Not necessarily
whether or not the decision developed a policy but how we present the outcome
of your deliberations before the Board of Appeals?</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Chinchilla</u>: Right.  How it has been done in the past.  What has been the role--is it merely objective reporting, or is it more of an advocacy role?  Report back on
the actual procedure, where there might be a need for improvement, or whether
you need the Commission to set a policy on how we want our decisions
presented on appeal (Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals).  Put this on
the "to do" list.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Green</u> in response: We will report back next week as to a date to actually
have a discussion.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Hills</u>: - Requested that the Commission get the copy of BOA agenda prior to
their (BOA) hearing rather than receive them in our folders after their hearing.</strong>
<p><strong>	<u>Theoharis</u>: The last Commission had a case before the BOA that they asked
the City Attorney for a ruling on as to what is appropriate for a Commissioner as
far as sending a letter to the BOA or being at the BOA in support of a decision
that the Commission has made.  Directed staff to add that to your findings so we
can know what we could or couldn't do.</strong>

<p>	15.<u>	REVIEW OF PAST WEEK'S EVENTS AT THE BOARD OF APPEALS &amp;  		BOARD OF SUPERVISORS</u>
<p>	<strong>BOA: - 1725 Lake Street--the Commission denied the request to demolish--Commission decision upheld +1 -2.  Board was supplied with the staff case report
and recommendation.  They were also supplied with a summary of the
Commission decision and the reasons for that decision.</strong>
<p><strong>		    - 723 Tehama St. case - Mr. PASSMORE has requested a re-hearing of
this case because it appears that Ms. Hestor did not receive adequate notice.</strong>
<p><strong>		    - 3100 Webster Street - last week Mr. PASSMORE noted that a decision
of the Planning Commission on a reclassification of property requires a two
thirds vote of the Board of Supervisors to overturn--he was wrong.  A recent
Charter change has amended the Planning Code and a rezoning initiated at the
Board now only requires a majority vote to overrule the Commission.</strong>
<p><strong>	-311 notifications: in re-looking at this procedure we are discovering that in
use it does seem to be inadequate.  The form has not been changed since the
adoption of 311.  Staff has been asked to look at this process and recommend
ways to improve it.  We will submit a redraft of the form for review by the public
and you by the first week in September.  We hope to be able to put an approved
improved redraft of the form into use the first week of October.  (Commissioner

<p>		<u>945 BATTERY STREET</u>, southwest corner of Battery and Green Streets, Lot 1
in Assessor's Block 135 -- Request under Planning Code Section 321 for
authorization to convert an existing 48,300 square foot warehouse building to
office space, including the addition of office space in  new mezzanines within
the existing first and third floors and the addition of approximately 6,900 square
feet of office space in a newly-constructed single-story penthouse, for a total of
approximately 58,840 square feet of office space, within a C-2 (Community

<p><strong>	ACTION: Approved as amended: </strong>
<p><strong>	D.</strong>
<p><strong> <em>			The Negative Declaration for the Project indicates that the Project
site is well-served by transit.  Six Muni bus lines and two Golden
Gate Transit lines pass within two blocks of the Project site.  All of
these transit lines operate with available capacity, and thus have
excess capacity to absorb additional transit trips generated by the
Project.</em></strong>
<p><strong>		</strong>
<p><strong><em>			Pursuant to Chapter 38 of the San Francisco Administrative Code,
each developer of a development in the Downtown Area that
includes the addition of new office use must pay a Transit Impact
Development Fee (TIDF) which is related directly to the incremental
financial burden imposed upon Muni both for initial capital outlay
for acquisition of equipment and facilities construction, and for the
long-term operation, maintenance and replacement of those
facilities.    The Project site is within the Downtown Area as defined
in the ordinance and the Project Sponsor shall be required to pay a
TIDF upon the issuance of a temporary permit of occupancy and as
a condition precedent to issuance of any certificate of final
completion and occupancy, whichever occurs first.  Based on the
proposed addition of 52,715 gross square feet of new office space in
this Project, and a TIDF rate equal to $5.00 for each gross square
foot of office use, the Project Sponsor would be required to pay a
TIDF of $263,575.  </em>	</strong>
<p><strong>		Urban Design Element</strong>
<p><strong>		<u>CONSERVATION</u></strong>
<p><strong>	<em>	d.	As discussed in the Negative Declaration for the Project, the Project
will not have a significant effect on Muni transit service or
overburden streets or neighborhood parking.  The Project area is
well-served by transit, with several major cross-town lines nearby
on Sansome and Battery Streets, Broadway and The Embarcadero,
all of which have excess capacity.  The Project site is within the
Downtown Area, and pursuant to Chapter 38 of the San Francisco
Administrative Code, the Project Sponsor will be required to pay a
Transit Impact Development Fee (TIDF) upon issuance of a
temporary permit of occupancy or a certificate of final completion
and occupancy.    Based on the proposed addition of 52,715 gross
square feet of new office space in this Project, and a TIDF rate equal
to $5.00 for each gross square foot of office use, the Project

SOUGHT:</strong> The proposal is to construct a two-story-over-garage addition at the
front of the lot and connect it to the existing legal non-conforming, single-family
dwelling at the rear of the subject lot via a ground level corridor.  The bulk of the
expansion will be at the front of the lot and is code-complying.  However, a
portion of the proposed one-story, ground-level, 13'-9" by 20'-0" corridor
connecting the existing house with the bulk of the proposed addition would be
located in the required rear yard, and would therefore require a rear yard
variance.

<p>E.	<u>CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL MOTION --Public Hearing 		Closed</u>
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		98.447EZ	 (ROSETTER)
<p>		<u>3100 WEBSTER STREET</u> Consideration of a proposal to amend the zoning
map for the property at 3100 Webster Street, being Lot 12, Assessor's Block
508 (one lot in the block bounded by Webster, Moulton, Buchanan and
Greenwich Streets) from an RH-2 (Two Family Residential) District to an NC-3
(Moderate-Scale Neighborhood Commercial District.  The proposed amendment
would allow the existing Del Sol Motel  (formerly the Plantation Inn) to remain. 
Since the property was reclassified from R-3 (Multi-Family Residential) to RH-2
in 1978, a motel on this property has been a non-conforming use with a
mandate to conform in twenty years (1998).  Conforming to the RH-2 District
would require that the motel be converted to residential use.  Since hotels are a
conditional use in the NC-3 District, the reclassification would allow the motel to
continue with any expansion or intensification as a hotel requiring a conditional
use authorization from the Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission
may also consider recommending reclassification to an NC-2 (Small Scale
Neighborhood Commercial District) as an alternative.
<p><strong>	<u>	NOTE</u>: On August 6, 1998, following testimony, the Commission closed
the public hearing and entertained a motion to approve with conditions. 
The motion failed to carry by a vote of +2 -4, resulting in an intent to
disapprove.  Final language 8/13/98. Commissioner Martin was absent.</strong>

<p><strong>	ACTION (2):	Disapprove proposal with an amendment to the motion:</strong>
<p><strong>		WHEREAS, In response to public concerns about certain uses allowed
under NC-3 zoning, the owner of 3100 Webster Street suggested, and the
Department of Planning staff recommended the alternative reclassification
to an NC-2 (Small-Scale Neighborhood Commercial) District which district
controls existing hotels/motels in the same manner as an NC-3 District,
but is more restrictive in the nature of other use permitted.</strong>
<p><strong>		THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT, The Commission finds that the
proposed reclassification to an NC-3 or and NC-2 District would be
inconsistent with the most of the eight priority planning policies
established by Planning Code Section 101.1 in that:</strong>

clarify definition of and obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord
regarding the provision of bicycle facilities in or for building space leased to the
City and deleting obsolete implementation schedule provisions.  The amendment
would add Section 155.2 to require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would add Section 155.3 to require shower and
locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing
major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces
in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking
requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3 (Downtown
Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be required by
this amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and

Commission will consider a Resolution of Intent to initiate the following
amendments to the General Plan, Planning Code and Zoning Maps at a duly
advertised public hearing to be held on Thursday, September 17, 1998 after
certification of a Final Subsequent Environmental Impact Report on these
proposed actions and prior to the adoption of proposed Mission Bay North and
South Redevelopment Plans.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		Consideration of a Resolution of Intent to Initiate amendments to the General
Plan, Planning Code text and Zoning Map for the area of the City commonly
known as Mission Bay, generally bounded by Townsend Street to the north,
Third Street and Terry A. Francois Boulevard to the east, Mariposa Street to the
south and the Interstate 280 and Seventh Street to the west.  Please note that
included within this broad area are four parcels or portions thereof that will not
be included within a Mission Bay North (north of China Basin Channel) or
Mission Bay South Redevelopment Project Area:  Three parcels in two
Assessor's Blocks (AB) are located within the area north of the channel (AB
3796/lots 1 and 2 and AB 3797/lot 1) and a portion of one parcel is located
south of the channel (a portion of AB 3880 running easterly of Third Street and
north of the intersection of Third and Fourth Streets (Seawall Lot 337), which is
owned by the Port of San Francisco.
<br wp="br1"><br wp="br2">
<p>		On September 17, 1998 the Planning Commission will be asked to consider the
following amendments to facilitate the adoption of a Mission Bay North
Redevelopment Plan and a Mission Bay South Redevelopment Plan:  (1)
Elimination of the current Mission Bay Plan by deleting Part 2 of the Central
Waterfront Plan, an element of the City's General Plan; (2) Adoption of the
current Mission Bay Plan as "Mission Bay Guidelines" which, along with the
general policies of Part 1 of the Central Waterfront Plan and the general policies
of the other Elements of the General Plan, would govern property in the four
parcels which are currently included in the Mission Bay Plan yet would not be
included in a Mission Bay North or South Redevelopment Project Area; (3)
Amendments to maps, figures and text descriptions in various Elements of the
General Plan to reflect the proposed Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South
Redevelopment Plans; (4) Amendments to Article 9 of the Planning Code to
reference Mission Bay Guidelines applicable to the four remaining parcels
rather than a Mission Bay Plan, to reference the Mission Bay North and South
Redevelopment Plans for the Redevelopment Plan Areas, and to describe the
four parcels that would remain subject to the provisions of Article 9; (5)
Amendments to Zoning Map 8 to eliminate specific use districts of Article 9
which would no longer be applicable with the adoption of the Redevelopment
Plans and to continue the use district (Mission Bay Office District) which would
govern property located within the three parcels north of China Basin Channel
which would not be subject to the proposed Mission Bay North Redevelopment
Plan.  Those properties in AB 3796/Lots 1 and 2 and AB 3797/Lot 1 would
continue to be governed by Article 9, the Mission Bay Guidelines, the general
policies of the Central Waterfront Plan and the general policies of the General
Plan.  A portion of Lot 1 of Assessor's Block 3880, under the jurisdiction of the
Port of San Francisco, would not be included in the Mission Bay South
Redevelopment Project Area and would remain designated MB-OS--Mission
Bay Open Space Use District; and (6) Amendments to Zoning Map 8H to
eliminate the height and bulk district designations for the land that would be
governed by the Mission Bay North and Mission Bay South Redevelopment
Plans.   For further information, please contact planner Susana Montana at
(415) 558-6313.

<p><strong>	PACIFIC EXCHANGE:</strong> North side of Folsom Street, between Spear and Main
Street.  Assessor's Block 3740, Lots 27, 29, 30, 31 and 32.  The proposed
project would expand the existing Rincon Point-South Beach Redevelopment
Area by approximately 60,000 square feet, demolish two existing buildings, and
construct a new headquarters for the Pacific Exchange to accommodate the
Pacific Exchange and the needs of its 550 members and its clearing firms, at
least through the year 2010.  The project would construct a new 17-story, 234-foot tall structure to replace its existing operations now in several locations in the
Financial District.  The new building would include a three-level 550-valet space
parking garage below grade and new trading floors above grade, with offices and
support space to accommodate up to 3,260 employees.  The parking garage
would likely be owned by the City and operated by the City or a non-profit
corporation as a public parking garage.  Above the parking garage, the building
would contain about 425,500 gross square feet of space in two main
components: a 5-story Trading and Technology Center, consisting of about
143,100 gross square feet, and a 17-story office tower, consisting of about
274,000 gross square feet.  The ground floor would contain about 8,400 square
feet of retail space.  The project would require an amendment of the Rincon
Point-South Beach Design for Development document to provide development
standards for the project site.  Conforming General Plan amendments would also
be required.

<p><u>		555 FLORIDA STREET/2828 18TH STREET</u>: <strong>APPEAL OF THE PRELIMINARY
NEGATIVE DECLARATION.</strong>  The proposed project would reuse three vacant buildings
for 49 live/work units 20,000 square feet of commercial/industrial use, with below grade
parking.  The buildings were part of the former Best Foods industrial facility (Assessor's
Block 4017/Lots 2, 3, 4 and 5).  The existing four lots would be merged into one parcel
and re-subdivided into four parcels with different configurations.  The four-story plus
basement 555 Florida Street building, 8,00 sq. ft. Of commercial/industrial use, with
approximately 41,500 gross square feet, would contain 15 live/work units and about 12
parking spaces below grade with ingress and egress on Florida Street. The two three- to
four-story buildings plus basement at 2828 18th Street, consist of approximately
101,850 gross square feet, and would contain 34 live/work units 12,000 sq. ft. Of
commercial/industrial use and 49 basement parking spaces with ingress and egress on
18th Street.  The exterior dimensions of these buildings would not be changed.  The
primary pedestrian entrance for both buildings would be through a courtyard on Florida
Street.  The project is located in a M-1 (light industrial) Zoning District and a 50-X height
and bulk district.  <strong></strong>

Planning Code (Zoning Ordinance) by amending Section 155.1 to clarify definition of
and obligations of the responsible City official and the landlord regarding the provision
of bicycle facilities in or for building space leased to the City and deleting obsolete
implementation schedule provisions.  The amendment would add Section 155.2 to
require bicycle parking in privately-owned and City-owned parking garages, and would
add Section 155.3 to require shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new
buildings and buildings undergoing major expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j)
already requires bicycle spaces in required accessory auto parking facilities.  There is
no auto parking requirement for uses other than residential use in the C-3 (Downtown
Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or would be required by this
amendment in downtown buildings except in residential buildings and buildings
primarily used as parking garages.
