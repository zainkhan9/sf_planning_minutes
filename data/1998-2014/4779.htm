The project would develop an approximately 362 - room hotel with an 5,000 sq. ft. ground floor
restaurant and 1,000 sq.ft. retail space in an existing building that is currently a vacant office
structure located at 500 California Street, at the corner of Montgomery Street (Assessor's Block
240, lot 3).  About 53,800 sq.ft. would be added to floors 2-17 on the north and west sides of the
L-shaped building, and above the roof (but not above the existing parapet),  for a total of
approximately 257,700 sq.ft. in building area. Two new floors would be created where existing
floors with high ceilings would be divided horizontally. The building is recognized by the City  to
have significant architectural character. The project requires approval under Section 309 for
Permit Review in C-3 District and a Permit to Alter for major alterations to a Category I building
identified in Article 11 of the City Planning Code.   It would also require a conditional use
authorization for hotel use in the C-3-0 Zoning District.</FONT></P>

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT.  The project would develop an approximately 362 - room
hotel with an 5,000 sq. ft. ground floor restaurant and 1,000 sq.ft. retail space in an existing
building that is currently a vacant office structure located at 500 California Street, at the corner of
Montgomery Street (Assessor's Block 240, lot 3).  About 53,800 sq.ft. would be added to floors
2-17 on the north and west sides of the L-shaped building, and above the roof (but not above the
existing parapet),  for a total of approximately 257,700 sq.ft. in building area. Two new floors
would be created where existing floors with high ceilings would be divided horizontally. The
building is recognized by the City  to have significant architectural character. The project
requires approval under Section 309 for Permit Review in C-3 District and a Permit to Alter for
major alterations to a Category I building identified in Article 11 of the City Planning Code.   It
would also require a conditional use authorization for hotel use in the C-3-0 Zoning District.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="-1">		You are invited to a public workshop to be held on Saturday, October 17, 1998 from 9:00 AM to
4:30 PM at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) building located at 450 Irwin Street
in the Showplace Square area.    The Citywide Land Use Study workshop will include a
presentation by Department staff on citywide land use issues, needs and constraints, followed
by public participation in the development of objectives for accommodating housing, industry
and commerce in San Francisco.  You will be asked to provide your own lunch.  In the
afternoon session, participants will be asked to join small groups to focus on specific topics
which may include: (1) location, design and affordability of new housing types including
residential lofts, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units and live/work units; (2) location, density,
height and scale of housing along transit corridors; (3) providing affordable housing for artists;
(4) providing land for industry, including multi-media, medical research and other emerging
industry types; (5) providing amenities in emerging neighborhoods, including open space,
convenience shopping, parking, transit and other public services; and (6) enforcement and
public notice procedures.  The small group sessions are designed to be "brainstorming"
sessions where you are encouraged to provide creative, yet feasible ideas and
recommendations.  All the comments and ideas at the end of the afternoon session will be
summarized and Department staff will conduct further research in the coming months before
preparing recommendations for Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors' actions. </FONT></P>

shower and locker facilities be provided in or for new buildings and buildings undergoing major
expansion.  Planning Code Section 155(j) already requires bicycle spaces in required
accessory auto parking facilities.  There is no auto parking requirement for uses other than
residential use in the C-3 (Downtown Commercial) Districts, so no bicycle parking is required or

4:30 PM at the California College of Arts and Crafts (CCAC) building located at 450 Irwin Street
in the Showplace Square area.    The Citywide Land Use Study workshop will include a
presentation by Department staff on citywide land use issues, needs and constraints, followed
by public participation in the development of objectives for accommodating housing, industry
and commerce in San Francisco.  You will be asked to provide your own lunch.  In the
afternoon session, participants will be asked to join small groups to focus on specific topics
which may include: (1) location, design and affordability of new housing types including
residential lofts, Single Room Occupancy (SRO) units and live/work units; (2) location, density,
height and scale of housing along transit corridors; (3) providing affordable housing for artists;
(4) providing land for industry, including multi-media, medical research and other emerging
industry types; (5) providing amenities in emerging neighborhoods, including open space,
convenience shopping, parking, transit and other public services; and (6) enforcement and
public notice procedures.  The small group sessions are designed to be "brainstorming"
sessions where you are encouraged to provide creative, yet feasible ideas and
recommendations.  All the comments and ideas at the end of the afternoon session will be
summarized and Department staff will conduct further research in the coming months before
preparing recommendations for Planning Commission and Board of Supervisors' actions. </FONT></P>

located between Market and Mission Streets and between 4th and 5th Streets and the entire
City Block located between Mission and Minna Streets and between 4th and 5th Streets.
Consideration of a proposed amendment to the Mid-Market and Yerba Buena Center (YBC)
Redevelopment Project Area Preliminary Plans and finding of consistency of the proposed
amendment with the General Plan, as it is proposed to be amended, and finding of
consistency with Section 101.1 of the Planning Code. The proposed Preliminary Plan
amendment would expand the boundaries of the YBC Project Area, facilitating the
development of the land to be added to the YBC Project Area for mixed use. The purpose of
the amendment is to enable the City and Redevelopment Agency to study the appropriateness
of using redevelopment powers to facilitate development within the expanded area. The
designation of the expanded area under Redevelopment Agency jurisdiction and development
of a project would require certification of an EIR, map amendments to Urban Design,
Commerce and Industry, and the Downtown elements of the General Plan to partially vacate
the Jessie Street right-of-way, to change the current Height and Bulk districts to allow higher
buildings, amendment of the YBC Redevelopment Plan and amendment to the YBC Design
for Development document, all of which would be the subject of later hearings before the
Planning Commission, the Redevelopment Commission and the Board of Supervisors. The
site is currently within C-3-R (Downtown Retail) and P (Public) Districts and the following
Height and Bulk Districts: 120-X, 160-S and 160-F.</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE="-1">  </FONT><FONT FACE="Helvetica" SIZE="-1"></FONT></P>
