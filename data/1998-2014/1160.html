Section 134 of the Planning Code states that in an RH-3 District, in the case of any lot that abuts along both its side lot lines upon lots with buildings that front on another street or alley, the minimum rear yard depth shall be 25 percent of the total depth of the lot, or 15 feet, whichever is greater.  On the approximately 80-foot deep subject lot, this results in a rear yard requirement of 20 feet, with the south side of the lot being considered the rear.  The proposed construction would project into the required rear yard by up to 11 feet at the ground (garage) floor level, extending to within 9 feet of the south property line.

      <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

      <p><i>Re: Process Question </i></p>

      <p>- Many times when a Discretionary Review is brought before them the DR requestor has issues that are not always the same as the issues that Commissioners have.</p>

          <p>- Regarding Lurmont Terrace, the project has been withdrawn and will be reconfigured as an alteration.  The Department will take a fresh look at it when it is resubmitted.  If there is a project that the Department has brought before the Commission, staff will take into account the Commission's concerns.</p>

          <p>- On a case that is withdrawn/re-submitted, when staff is aware that the Commission is concerned about certain issues and staff sees those evidence of those issues in the (new) plans, staff would still bring the project before the Commission.</p>

          <p>- The Commission can also request a Discretionary Review on any project.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Cell Phone Installation for 2599 Lombard Street</i></p>

      <p>- When a cell phone installation comes before the Commission and the emissions are below the standards, what the Commission decides upon is the information they are provided.</p>

      <p>- The only way that the Commission would be able to change the way things are addressed would be if there were any appraisals in terms of the coverage and capacity.</p>

      <p>- The Commission is taking the information as valid representations.</p>

      <p>- She asked that the meeting today be held in memory of Annie Powell who was killed in the Bay View District.</p>

      <p><i>Re:  Commissioner Antonini's comment:</i></p>

      <p>- Commissioner Antonini is correct.</p>

      <p>- Planners don't have the ability to know if the information submitted to them is correct--they are not wireless engineers.  The battles over antennas are being fought about health issues more than anything else.</p>

      <p>- It becomes a planning issue as a substitute for what they can talk about.</p>

      <p>- Unless the Planning Department hires wireless engineers, planers will continue to struggle with whether an antenna installation is necessary or desirable.</p>

      <p>- Maybe this needs to be dealt with at a federal level.</p>

      <p>- It was mostly a positive discussion.</p>

      <p>- The most important thing was that towards the end, Supervisor Peskin brought up the management structure of the department.</p>

      <p>- The issue about this was actually about how many senior planners there are, etc.</p>

      <p>- Sup. Peskin expressed that the senior management level was too heavy.</p>

      <p>- The project provides needed housing.</p>

      <p>- The project also provides retail space on the street level.</p>

      <p>- The setbacks should not be required because they confer little public benefit.</p>

      <p>- The suggestion of a setback is based on the setbacks on adjacent buildings.</p>

      <p>- He requested that the project be approved.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Roger Hall</font></p>

      <p>- The egress from the parking garage is right across the street from Silvercrest Residence with studio units for seniors.</p>

      <p>- All of the traffic on Shipley is a considerable hazard for the seniors.</p>

      <p>- He would rather have the egress on Folsom Street instead of Shipley Street.</p>

      <p>- He lives on Folsom Street.</p>

      <p>- He chose to live here because of the environment.  He is not against development.</p>

      <p>- She implores the Commission to provide an alternative that is code compliant.</p>

      <p>- There are too many exceptions to the building code.</p>

      <p>- Removing the soils, which will interrupt the piles in the adjacent building, could be dangerous.</p>

A rear yard modification is sought under Section 134(e) to provide rear yard open space within an inner court and on a 7th floor setback of 10-15 feet along Shipley Street.  A variance is sought from dwelling unit exposure requirements, as the horizontal dimensions of the inner court do not meet the requirements for an open area as defined under Section 140(a)(2) for dwelling unit exposure, and 27 of the 70 units have no exposure other than this inner court.

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Barry Brown - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

      <p>- He displayed diagrams of the project showing the shadow impacts during the seasons of the year.</p>

      <p>- The property will cast long shadows onto the large bay windows on the west side of the building.</p>

      <p>- The bay window currently allows afternoon sunlight and radiant heat into his primary living area during five critical fall and winter months.</p>

      <p>- The proposed project to the west will take that away. </p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Patrice Motley</font></p>

      <p>- She lives in the other unit of the Discretionary Review requestor.</p>

      <p>- There were meetings with the rest of the homeowners association.</p>

      <p>- They are trying to peacefully coexist.</p>

      <p>- They would like to have the part of the building that has not been built yet pushed back so they can receive some sunlight.</p>

      <p>- She lives on the opposite side of the building.</p>

      <p>- She is not opposed to the construction of the building; she is just concerned about the size of it.</p>

      <p>- The light studies that Barry Brown did show how detrimental the project will be.</p>

      <p>- She had hoped that everyone could work together.</p>

      <p>- A new building will improve the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- She hopes that the architect will consider some of the proposals.</p>

      <p>- Her neighborhood association is in agreement with the project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) David Silverman - Representing Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- The height limit in this area is 40 feet but the proposed construction is lower than that.</p>

      <p>- The Discretionary Review requestor is worried about direct sunlight.</p>

      <p>- The DR requestor's building is as tall or taller than the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- There are no exceptional or extraordinary circumstances in this case.</p>

      <p>- This project will provide much needed housing, especially family housing.</p>

      <p>- It is designed to be consistent with the other buildings on the block.</p>

      <p>Preliminary Recommendation:  Do not take Discretionary Review and approve demolition.</p>

      <p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">Supervisor Dufty</font></p>

      <p>- There have been a lot of issues on growth.</p>

      <p>- He is concerned about this project because of bulk.</p>

      <p>- He is looking for ways to not recreate the anger that has happened before.</p>

      <p>- The home is of high quality, but in this neighborhood there is a fear of demolitions and large buildings.</p>

      <p>- He is open to see how everyone can work together to have reasonable growth and respect the neighborhood character.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Larry Mivoy</font></p>

      <p>- He is mostly concerned about the demolition and thinks it should be denied.</p>

      <p>- Two houses will be built after the demolition.  The average price of houses is now $779,000.</p>

      <p>- If the city is going to allow a demolition of affordable houses then the replacement houses should be as affordable.</p>

      <p>- The city cannot have all the houses be million dollar homes.</p>

      <p>- The Commission should deny the demolition.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Father Nazarin </font></p>

      <p>- He lives on Valley Street next to the proposed house.</p>

      <p>- If the purpose of the Commission is to preserve the character of the neighborhood, then they should preserve the house.</p>

      <p>- The character has a certain charm.  Trying to build a house with the size that is being proposed would destroy the character.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jackie Garry</font></p>

      <p>- She has lived next door to the proposed house since 1968.</p>

      <p>- Her house is very charming.  This type of housing is being destroyed all over Noe Valley.</p>

      <p>- People like me could never afford the house that is being proposed.</p>

      <p>- He lives across the street from the proposed project.</p>

      <p>- These projects are changing the quality of the neighborhood.</p>

      <p>- He is please to see that the Planning Commission requests setbacks, etc.</p>

      <p>- He urges the Commission to incorporate into the review process the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bruce Bauman - Representing the Project Sponsor</font></p>

      <p>- There are a number of speakers that are here in support of the project.</p>

      <p>- The project sponsor works with the neighbors to carefully sculpture a project that fits with the neighborhood and the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

      <p>- The lot can be subdivided and two units created, thereby increasing housing in the city.</p>

      <p>- The house is vacant and it is in deplorable condition.</p>

      <p>- The lot is on a very steep street so the houses step up the hill.</p>

      <p>- The proposed houses will be on the top of the hill.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Steve Antenaros - Project Architect</font></p>

      <p>- He displayed a rendering of the proposed houses.</p>

      <p>- The upper floors are not visible.</p>

      <p>- The design guidelines encourage this type of house.</p>

      <p>- Houses can be larger.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Raimond Totah</font></p>

      <p>- He has lived near the proposed house since 1956.</p>

      <p>- He will be impacted the most.</p>

      <p>- The house is unstable.  That is why the person that lived there moved out.</p>

      <p>- If the two poles that are in the garage were taken out, the house would collapse.</p>

      <p>- There are a lot of large houses in the neighborhood.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Brian McGee</font></p>

      <p>- He and his family own the property.</p>

      <p>- The have had a business in San Francisco for about 40 years.</p>

      <p>- Many people that work for him live in the area.</p>

      <p>- Their projects are designed to be compatible with the neighborhood and they do extensive outreach.</p>

      <p>- This project has overwhelming support from the immediate neighbors.</p>

      <p>- They always try to deal with issues that people might have.</p>

      <p>- They also try to minimize the impact of construction as much as possible.</p>

      <p>- There are many buildings that are not suitable for today's family needs.</p>

      <p>- He hopes that the Commission will support this project.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Tracey McGee</font></p>

      <p>- He and his family have been building homes for about 40 years.</p>

      <p>- They have built numerous homes in the City.</p>

      <p>- They have a reputation for building quality homes.</p>

      <p>- Before doing a project, they speak to the neighbors and do an analysis of the surrounding homes.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Janet McGee</font></p>

      <p>- There has been a large neighborhood outreach--going door-to-door and presenting the project.</p>

      <p>- They have spent about 80 hours presenting the project during nights and weekends.</p>

      <p>- She displayed a lot map showing the homes that have signed a petition and support of the project.</p>

      <p>- They have made every effort to address the issues and concerns of the neighbors.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Monica McGee</font></p>

      <p>- They have the support of the immediate neighbors.</p>

      <p>- The Discretionary Review requestor has tried to sell his house to them.</p>

      <p>- The Discretionary Review requestor has been very hostile.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Angus McCarthy - Residential Builders Association</font></p>

      <p>- If people were very passionate against this project they would be here tonight.</p>

      <p>- It is unfortunate that it's about 90 percent negotiating and 10 percent building.</p>

      <p>- This developer has done a good job designing a project following the Residential Design Guidelines, dealing with neighbor's issues, etc.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Charles Breidinger</font></p>

      <p>- The very top story will not be seen from the sidewalk.</p>

      <p>- The houses that are being proposed are truly family housing.</p>

      <p>- Parents are moving in with their children and children are moving in with their parents.</p>

      <p>- There is a demand for this type of house.</p>

      <p>- The children are working downtown and can afford to pay the mortgage.</p>

      <p>- Families are joining incomes to pay for mortgages.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Kieran Bukley</font></p>

      <p>- He is in support of the project.</p>

      <p>- When it comes to family housing, this would be considered the best example of family housing.</p>

      <p>- As far as the top floor, it will not be seen from the street.</p>

      <p>- The McGee's do top class work.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Grace Shanahan</font></p>

      <p>- There is high quality craftsmanship in all the projects that the McGee's build.</p>

      <p>- This project is no exception.  It would be an ideal family home.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) David O'Keeffe</font></p>

      <p>- He is a small builder in San Francisco.</p>

      <p>- They have not been able to solve the issues that the Discretionary Review requestor has.</p>

      <p>- If the average family has at least two children, houses need to be larger.</p>

      <p>- This project is being well executed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Sean Keighran</font></p>

      <p>- Neighborhood character and good design comes in all shapes and sizes, especially sale prices.</p>

      <p>- The people that are opposed to this project are not interested in neighborhood character, but to stop this project instead.</p>

      <p>- It is time that communities [accept] the burden of their responsibility for the much-needed housing in San Francisco.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Jim Keith - Residential Builders Association</font></p>

      <p>- There is no place in the planning code that states a building cannot go higher than the neighbor.</p>

      <p>- There is nothing in the residential design guidelines that would require taking the top floor off.</p>

      <p>- The DR requestor is mistakenly stating that this project should not be demolished.</p>

      <p>- Everyone has testified that the McGee's build quality homes.</p>

      <p>- He urged the Commission to move this project as proposed.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Joe O'Donaghue</font></p>

      <p>- This is not a monster home.  A four-bedroom home is not a monster home.</p>

      <p>- Bigger homes are needed for families.</p>

      <p>- There is another new set of values for home needs these days.</p>

      <p>- There is no way to see the top floor from the street level.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(-) Tamara Galanter</font></p>

      <p>- She lives on 28<sup>th</sup> Street.</p>

      <p>- She appreciates the developers and has spoken to them about her issues.</p>

      <p>- This project is inconsistent with the Residential Design Guidelines which requires that the building be in scale with the adjacent buildings and that it respects the mid block open space.</p>

      <p>- She is willing to continue to work with the developers on the issues.</p>

      <p>- She requested that the Commission scale down the size of the building.</p>

      <p><font class="heading2">(+) Mr. Santos - Project Engineer</font></p>

      <p>- The structures that the McGee's build go beyond the requirements of the code [for quality].</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Demolitions</i></p>

    </blockquote></blockquote><ul><ul><p>- Tomorrow a number of his members will be looking at a piece of property in Oakland.</p>

    <p>- Already he is thinking of moving out of this city.</p>

    <p>- A member of his organization moved to Burlingame because he was able to purchase a larger house down there.</p>

    <p>- The reality is in 1986 when demolition was active in the Richmond, there was no family housing being built.</p>

    <p>- The cost of doing &quot;defacto&quot; demolitions is more expensive than doing a complete demolition.</p>

    <p>- Demolitions are happening less and less.</p>

    <p>- It is important to revisit the demolition ordinance.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Requiring ground floor retail when there isn't' a market for it.</i></p>

    <p>- He has his office on Howard Street between 7<sup>th</sup> and 8<sup>th</sup>.  Recently a building was constructed with ground retail that has been vacant for over a year.</p>

    <p>- Why is there a requirement for ground floor retail when there is no demand for it.  Windows get broken and vandalism is done to these empty space.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Angus McCarthy</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  A market for larger family houses</i></p>

    <p>- He has already outgrown his house because his family is getting bigger.</p>

    <p>- Many families cannot purchase bigger homes because there aren't many.</p>

    <p>- It is important to allow certain neighborhoods to allow larger homes.</p>

    <p>- If people want to purchase a million dollar home they should be allowed to do it.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Shawn Kegran</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Evaluation of having square footage </i></p>

    <p>- The square footage worries him.  It does not affect his impact as a pedestrian on the street.</p>

    <p>- The commission should not pay too much attention to the square footage of a home if it follows the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

    <p>- A candidate to purchase a home can purchase two houses and merge them or he/she can compete with other people who cannot afford a house and rent.</p>

    <p>- The housing market is recyclable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Keith</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Polity on the demolition of residential buildings</i></p>

    <p>- If there is a circumstance when a lot can become a multiple lot and this is not allowed, then this policy is not going to work.</p>

    <p>- What people will do is go through the remodeling route and make the houses larger.</p>

    <p>Adjournment: 9:30 p.m.</p>
