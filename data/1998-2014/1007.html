Lee:   Requested a presentation from Landmarks Board, Mayor's Office of Housing, Mayor's Office of Community Development; Transportation Authority; Redevelopment Agency; Coalition of S.F. Neighbors; S.F. Tomorrow; Mayor's Small Business Commission; Chamber of Commerce, and SPUR<br>Commissioner S. Lee:  Commented on action taken at last week's meeting (1/9/03) on the Fourth and Freelon Streets Special Use District legislation.  The Commission agreed to endorse the legislation with a number of amendments.  However, they (the Commission) did not receive a copy of the actual legislation with their amendments prior to it being transmitted to the Board of Supervisors.  She requested that, in future, the Director should make sure the Commission also receives a copy of that transmittal.  She thought that the Commission was very clear that they wanted the project to come back to the Commission, in its entirety, as a conditional use.  She would like to see that actual language in the transmittal to the Board and in the legislation.  She has had second thoughts and now feels that the Department should charge fees that are commiserate with a conditional use.  She recalls that there is language in there (the amended legislation) that is less than what is normally charged.  What can the Commission now do if they want to change that?<br>Commissioner Feldstein:  Also concerned with the language in the final draft of the legislation on the Special Used District forwarded to the Board.  Last week, she specifically wanted to see what they had done in writing, but in the interest of the late hour, we moved on with an oral summary.  She is concerned that the language contained in the preliminary draft of the resolution does not reflect all the changes requested by the commissioners.  She is very uncomfortable that something might be forwarded that is not an accurate reflection.<br>Commissioner S. Lee:  If legislation comes over from the Board, she feels it is very important that this Commission see any changes in writing before they actually adopt them and they are transmitted to the Board.<br>Commissioner Antonini:  There are three components to this project--the builder, the recipients of the low cost housing, and the neighborhood.  He feels that there is a tendency on the part of the first two to go with as much height and bulk as possible because the incentives are there.  Whereas the neighborhood would like us to make the project as acceptable as possible in terms of design, setbacks,  and other items.  He has met with members of the Forth Street Neighborhood Association and urged them to get in touch with their Supervisors and try to build flexibility into the legislation that would allow us (the Commission) to have a revenue stream available to make modifications to that building to make it as pleasing as possible who live in the area.  He feels that all have to agree that compromise is necessary here.  It is also very important that since this is the first of what could be many projects of this type, that it not be perceived as some sort of back-room deal and that all parties can try to get something out of this that satisfies them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commissioner Feldstein:  If there is language in the existing draft about a model&ndash;that was not part of our (the Commission's) intent last week as she understood it. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br>-    Responded to Commissioner W. Lee's request regarding scheduling meetings with different City agencies --  1) If you would like to create additional meetings to accomplish this, we can do that.  2) It is very difficult to try to organize this and try to at the same time keep the workload we are currently engaged in.  February 13 is the target date for our budget and maybe these groups can participate as part of that process.  I can't see that discussion taking place without it being linked to resources.  We will try to schedule future presentations without overloading the Commission.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Responded to Commissioner S. Lee's concerns regarding the Special Use District legislation.   The Department is given 10 days from the day of the Commission's action to transmit that action to the Clerk of the Board.  The date for this legislation ends on Tuesday.  The resolution with your recommendations has not been transmitted to the Clerk of the Board.  He agrees that Commissioners should be given the opportunity to review their amendments and invited all commissioners to review and get back to him with any matter they feel does not represent the action taken (by the Commission).  However, in order to have another opportunity to effect some change to the legislation you must first rescind your previous action, set a new hearing date, and allow for re-noticing requirements within the 90-day timeline.  (Commissioner Feldstein:  Requested that for this legislation and in the future, the Commission receive any written drafts as soon as they are available.  She expects to have delivered to her for review the draft language to make sure it is an accurate reflection.)  (Commissioner S. Lee:  Asked if it was possible to sever the fee amendment from the draft and restate or come to a different recommendation before transmitting to the Board?)  The Director responded that the City Attorney or Zoning Administrator might want to respond officially, but he felt that the Commission took an action with a vote.  To change that, the Commission would have to rescind that action and schedule another hearing.  Stated that Commissioners could still express to the Supervisors their individual views, and the Department would also communicate to the Board that even after the Commission's action, you re-thought it and would really rather see a full conditional use fee consistent with all other conditional uses.  (Commissioner Feldstein:  Concerned that the draft document transmitted to the Clerk of the Board accurately reflect the actions of the Commission.  She has seen the draft and does not feel that it accurately reflects the actions of the Commission.  It was her understanding that they (the Commission) would see the draft before it was transmitted to the Board in a timely fashion.  If it needs to be delivered to the Clerk by Tuesday, then we need adequate time to review what is quite complex, make sure it's accurate, deliver those comments and have time for those comments to be incorporated, and then see those again to make sure that it is accurate.)  The Director stated that he felt that (this discussion) was going beyond what is permissible for a non-scheduled item.  He stated that he did not believe that the Commission gave clear instruction to forward the draft document to Commissioners for review prior to transmitting to the Clerk of the Board.  He requested that in the future, Commissioners or interested Commissioners should explicitly state that you would like to see the document in a draft form before it is transmitted.  The Department wants the document to accurately reflect what the Commission said.  If you don't believe it reflects that, we can change that.  (Commissioner Antonini:  For clarity &ndash; The project will come back to the Commission for design, height and bulk before approval?)  The Director stated that was always part of the legislation and had not changed.  (Commissioner Hughes:  The majority of projects or resolutions that we pass may not rise to the level of complexity as this, and it may not require that we see every resolution prior to it being sent to the Clerk.  But if we do want to see it, I think we should give clear and direct request to have that occur.  I recall the discussion.  But as I recall it, I do not recall a clear request sent to the Director to see that.  In the future, if we do want to see it, we should give explicit instructions or requests.)<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Announced that the Department will received a grant for $100,000.  The purpose of this grant is to carry out a community based transportation plan for the Glen Park Neighborhood around the BART station.  The source of these funds come from the California Department of Transportation, Bay Area Rapid Transit, as well as the San Francisco Public Library.  The grant requires that we execute a contract with a consultant.  We have prepared a memorandum to you that includes the contract agreements.  The conditions of the funding and the Department's desire is that you (the Commission) play a role in endorsing this before we enter into this contract.  If you have any questions related to this, under Commission Matters you can express them or you can let me know as early as possible.  (Commissioner W. Lee:  Can the work be done in-house instead of contracting it out?)   The document will be in your packet for next week.  Look it over and we will respond to you questions.  My guess to your question however is no.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last week's meeting, Commission W. Lee requested a status report on several projects that were primarily in the Mayor's Office of Housing.  Also, included in your packets will be the Department's response to the status of each of those projects.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>Board of Supervisors (reported by the Director of Planning):<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certification of EIR  for the Cruise Terminal was continued for one week.  <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Appeal of an action taken by the Director of Planning on 10/17/02.  I considered a conditional use authorization to install antennas for Metro PCS at 2444-2454 Noriega St.  I approved the conditional use.  The decision was appealed to the Board of Supervisors and it was continued once to allow the new Supervisor for this District to be sworn in.  At last Monday's meeting, the Board voted 10 to 1 to overturn the Planning Director's decision.<br>Board of Appeals (reported by the Zoning Administrator):<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2000 the Board of Supervisors added the term  Liquor Store  to neighborhood       commercial.  Prior to that, liquor stores were classified as general retail.  A concern expressed by the Board of Supervisors and the general public about spill-over facts of liquor stores and such.   Our understanding was that there was no accessory use.  Any off-site liquor sales&ndash;no matter how little&ndash;was a liquor store.  There was a case at 5843 Geary Blvd.  were the Zoning Administrator wrote a determination that adding a very small amount of liquor would not be permitted.  This was appealed to the Board of Appeals  They found in fact that the language did allow accessory use for liquor.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1878 Great Highway &ndash;  property that had a number of property line windows looking down the Great Highway.  The adjacent property was building up and there was concern about the view.

The site is located at 40-50 Lansing Street, on Assessor's Block 3749, Lot 11, in the Rincon Hill area.  The 20,205 sf site fronts on guy Place and Lansing Street, between First and Second Streets.  Two on-street loading spaces are planned; one on Guy Place and one on Lansing Street.  The site is within a RC-4 (Residential Commercial Combined, High Density) zoning district, the Rincon Hill Special Use Subdistrict and an 84-X height and bulk district.  The project would require variances from the following provisions of the Planning Code: Freight Loading; dwelling unit exposure; and from the Rincon Hill Special Use District; and Conditional Use authorization for construction of a residential structure over 40 feet tall.  <br>Preliminary Recommendation:  Uphold the Mitigated Negative Declaration. <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEAKER(S) (on a request to continue only):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(-)  Ken Morrison, (made the request for continuance)<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Received a hand delivered package on Friday of the 39 pages of the staff's comments.

Then it was located at the Franklin Square Park as a temporary site while something better was found.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we adopted this program, about two or three years ago, the program was still located in those trailers.  By this time, the trailers were dilapidated and falling apart.

They make up the majority of the day laborers and they would benefit from this new center.  We talk about a population that is definitely under served.  We talk about a group of people, although they work incredible hard, very rarely get many of the advantages many of us take for granted here in San Francisco.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For probably ten years,  this is a program, the Day Labor Program are a group of people, that had political problems in front of them.  People who had been seen by others, who has more, people who are undesirable in the neighborhood<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently they are operating out of trailers.  Day Labor Program can no provide the services, can not provide the access that really the labors deserve in San Francisco.  <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Day Laborers deserve this center.  This center proposed in any neighborhood in San Francisco would probably come with some neighborhood opposition.  <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Urged the Commission to favorably consider this project.  Do your best for the entire City and County of San Francisco--in this case, the City of Saint Francis--where we have open arms. We are a city of refuge.  We are known to do what we can to give the underdog any advantage, or any opportunity we can.<br>(-)  Steve Williams<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is crucial that this Commission vote yes in favor of this proposal for the safety and dignity of the day labors.<br>(-)   Mariana Biturro<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The workers need a dignified place.

Sometimes what is appropriate is in the mind or  eyes of the beholder.  And sometimes those situations change on a daily basis.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have read the report and believe this will be an appropriate site.<br>(-)   Toby Levine<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She would like to see this Commission vote in favor that the program and have it established at this site.<br>(-)   Rosabella Safron<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are a lot of political issues surrounding this project.  But the issue that we are here today to discuss is whether this is an appropriate site for the Day Labor Program?  <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She urged the Commission to look at the fact that traffic congestion is a non-issue.  Once the laborers are at the site, it will do a lot to alleviate the traffic problem.  The current traffic problems are not caused solely because of the day labors.  They are caused by speeders and by all kinds of issues that have nothing to do with the labors.<br>(-)   Andre Rocker<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supports the project.<br>(-)   Joaquin Gutierrez<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Us laborers do not have support from the Police.
