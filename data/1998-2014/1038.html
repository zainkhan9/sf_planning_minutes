        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Inclusionary Housing </i></p>

        <p>- The Nonprofit Housing Association of Northern California has recently released a study of inclusionary policies throughout California.  It is more up to date than the Sedway Report and it is more inclusive since it has more jurisdictions.  It would be helpful if this information could be made available to the Commission.</p>

    <ul><ul><p>8. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Commissioner William Lee's Comments</i></p>

        <p><i>Re: Exactions</i></p>

        <p>- In the C-3 Districts (the downtown districts), primarily for office, a number of exactions are collected.</p>

        <p>- Open space is $2.00 per square foot to build a major downtown park and there has been a lot of money collected on this but most of the money went to the improvement of Union Square.  There is a $1.00 per square foot fee for childcare or the project can provide childcare on site.  Most projects have paid the fee.</p>

        <p>- In a larger area than downtown there is a fee called &quot;TIDF&quot; (Transit Impact Development Fee).  This covers East of Van Ness Avenue.  This is $5.00 per square foot.</p>

        <p>- There is the inclusionary housing ordinance which was adopted by the Commission and passed by the Board of Supervisors.  This depends on what the use is.  Office is one fee, Retail/Entertainment, Industrial, and it varies with the different uses.  The housing fee is up to $16.00 per square foot.  In the C-3 districts there is also a fee of 1% for art.   The Unified School District charges a fee for housing units.  This is the only housing fee that is not actually charged by the City or the Department but from the Unified School District which is another department.</p>

        <p><i>Re: Performance Measures for the Planning Department</i></p>

        <p>- He will try to get this information but he does not think there are any cities that are comparable to San Francisco.</p>

        <p><i>Response to Commissioner Antonini's Comments:</i></p>

        <p>- The Housing Element will be heard on October 9.  It would be appropriate to have a discussion on affordable housing on this date.</p>

        <p><i>Response to Commissioner Boyd:</i></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Number of units approved under Inclusionary Housing.</i></p>

        <p>- In many cases, projects have not broken ground so the project sponsors have not had to commit yet if they will include the units within the project or do offsite.  </p>

        <p>- Most projects are doing onsite affordable housing.  Few projects are taking advantage of the offsite.</p>

        <p><i>Response to Commissioner Feldstein:</i></p>

        <p>- He will get the Non Profit Association of Northern California report and provide a copy to the Commission.</p>

The property is currently used as a paved parking lot by the United States Postal Service (USPS) Annex and other government agencies for 270 vehicles.  The rezoning project includes rezoning part of Lot 1 in Assessor's Block 3746 and Lots 1 and 8 in Assessor's Block 3745 from the existing P (Public) to a zoning district that allows private development.  The requested rezoning is from P (Public) with height limits of 150 and 200 feet to RC-4 (Residential-Commercial Combined: High-Density) with a 300- and 400-foot height limit.  In addition, a Planning Code text amendment is requested to create a new Residential/Commercial sub-district under the Rincon Hill Special Use District overlay, and amendments to the <i>Rincon Hill Area Plan</i>, a part of the <i>San Francisco General Plan</i>.  The request for rezoning has been made in conjunction with development proposed at 300 Spear Street on Assessor's Block 3745, Lot 1, that would be a part of the rezoned area.  The third parcel requested to be rezoned is 345 Main Street, Lot 8 in Assessor's Block 3745, the remaining privately owned lot in the existing P district. The development portion of the project would consist of up to 725 residential units (about 825,000 gsf) and about 38,000 gsf of retail space.  It would include about 753 enclosed parking spaces and four loading spaces for the use of the development, and about 272 enclosed replacement parking spaces for the use of the USPS and other government agencies.  An 80-foot-tall building base would cover the site.  Two residential towers would rise above the building base to total heights of approximately 350 feet and 400 feet above the ground level.  The project would require a subdivision of Lot 1 to separate the development site from the Postal Service Annex.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) John Hentz - Mission National Bank</font></p>

        <p>- He is in support of this project.</p>

        <p>- The developer is responsible and has met all the requirements from the Planning Department.</p>

        <p>- This project will provide much needed housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Candice Macario</font></p>

        <p>- She recently graduated from college and it is difficult for her to find housing.</p>

        <p>- She is in support of the project because it will provide an opportunity for people like herself to have housing.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Theresa Sedell</font></p>

        <p>- She is in support of this project because it is an appropriate site for this type of project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) John Elberling</font></p>

        <p>- He has been working with the Planning Department for many years on projects in the South of Market area.</p>

        <p>- This is the wrong project, in the wrong time, in the wrong place.</p>

        <p>- Alleyways cannot be turned over to 7 or more story buildings.</p>

        <p>- How the Commission will decide on this project will be a very important precedent.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Laura Weil - Tehama Street Neighborhood Association</font></p>

        <p>- There have been numerous meetings with the project sponsor.</p>

        <p>- Yet this project is terrible for this site.  It will take away all of her sunlight.</p>

        <p>- Everyone who is opposed to this project lives on that street.</p>

        <p>- She submitted a petition with over 100 signatures of people who are opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- She displayed photographs of Clementina Street and how cars often block traffic.</p>

        <p>- This project is out of scale for this neighborhood</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Bushnell - Four-Fifty Clementina</font></p>

        <p>- He is opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- The neighborhood and surrounding South of Market areas are composed primarily of 20 to 40 foot high residential, commercial, mixed use and loft buildings.  This project will exceed this height.</p>

        <p>- Small-scale neighborhoods contribute to the identity of SOMA and should be enhanced to make better neighborhoods, not destroyed by inappropriately scaled developments.</p>

        <p>- This project is a real disaster and it should be turned down.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Brian Wallace</font></p>

        <p>- He lives in this neighborhood and it is a great neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- He is opposed to this project because the scale of the project is too large.</p>

        <p>- This is a very tiny and narrow street and this project does not belong there.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Klein</font></p>

        <p>- He lives in Daly City.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about the property values in the area where the project is being proposed.</p>

        <p>- This project will block the light and views of the adjacent buildings.</p>

        <p>- He read a letter from a resident of the area who is opposed to the project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Jason Born - SOMA West Interactive Neighborhood Group</font></p>

        <p>- He is opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- He is disappointed that the developers did not sufficiently respond to community-based input.</p>

        <p>- This project fell short of being successful because it failed to connect with the Folsom Street corridors' concerns and long-term goals.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) David Wallace</font></p>

        <p>- He is opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- He submitted a letter from a member of the public who is opposed to this project.</p>

        <p>- Clementina is not a very wide street so this project will cause a lot of problems.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Leonard Lee</font></p>

        <p>- He lives in San Francisco and hopes to one day own property.</p>

        <p>- He is in favor of any project that will provide housing.</p>

        <p>- He urges the Commission to approve this project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Robin Hager</font></p>

        <p>- He has seen this City go from affordable to not affordable.</p>

        <p>- He is in favor of the project.</p>

        <p>- He likes the design as well.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Bonnie Higgins</font></p>

        <p>- She likes the idea of the building.</p>

        <p>- This project will provide housing and that is always a plus.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Raul Araiza - Project Sponsor</font></p>

        <p>- A previous speaker read a letter from a member of the public who supposedly is against this project but the letter did not state the entire truth.</p>

        <p>- There were more speakers here to talk about the project but they had to leave because of the earthquake.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Approved as Amended:  1) Eliminate the top floor.  The affordable units and off-street parking will be reduced accordingly; 2) unbundled the parking; and 3) don't limit the parking to market rate units.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Discretionary Reviews</i></p>

    <p>- He is not a developer but he has been stuck in the Discretionary Review process as well as the Board of Permit Appeals process for two years trying to get a building permit.</p>

    <p>- It is a very simple project.  The previous Planning Commission modified the project but the neighbors were not satisfied with that result and they brought him before the current Planning Commission and now to the Board of Permit Appeals.</p>

    <p>- Any kind of delay costs thousands of dollars.  This has been very disruptive to his family.</p>

    <p>- He had made all sorts of plans but has not been able to see them through.</p>

    <p>- It is getting to the point that he will have to accept the changes his neighbors want.</p>

    <p>- He feels that he has been put on trial three times for a simple building permit.</p>

    <p>- He wanted to expose these comments and concerns to the Commission before discussing Discretionary Review reforms next week.</p>

    <p>Adjournment: 8:56 p.m. i<i>n memory of Robert McDonald.</i></p>

    <p>THESE MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 25, 2003.</p>

    <p>SPEAKERS: None</p>

    <p>ACTION: Approved</p>
