    <ul><ul><p>8.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini: </font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Long Range Planning regarding our calendar discussion of Eastern Neighborhoods: O</i>ne request involves the interview of firms that have left San Francisco in the last few years. Correspondence on this will be forthcoming, but has not yet received it.   Also, he has asked on numerous occasions for the names of PDR firms that recently have relocated to San Francisco and as yet, has not received them.  There has only been a broad characterization of these firms by type, but not by individual names.</p>

    </ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

        <ul><ul><p>- We do not often take an opportunity to express our appreciation for our leadership, especially for this Department and this Commission.</p>

        <p>- I would like to take this moment to say to the Department and its staff and with the leadership -- what a wonderful job you are doing utilizing your time and your resources with the things made available to you to complete your tasks, and to continue [developing] land use policy and taking the leadership role for the City.</p>

        <p>- For the staff that works hard, and supporting what this Commission does on a regular basics, for those who serve as secretaries, and those who serve as staff person for a particular project, your labor is quite beneficial to this Commission and certainly beneficial to the City as a whole.</p>

        <p>- To the Commission, for the fine job that it does, and for the time each of us expends, offers and contributes to help the work and the job of the Planning Commission. And more particularly to our President, Shelley Bradford-Bell.  For the time that this Commission has been a panel, and the items that have come before us, all of them, they have not been easy, and there might have been different sentiments voiced, expressed or harbored by individuals on the Commission, but yet there has always been a balance, a level approach to decision making. So I offer a word of commendation to Shelley Bradford-Bell as the president of this Commission--for what she does and for what she continues to do.  I have seen many of the Commissions in the City, and have seen Planning Commissions of the City and County of San Francisco prior to the empanelment of this group that serves on this Commission now where that [level approach to decision making] is not always the case.  This is a big job, and capable, quality leadership has been demonstrated by the president of this Commission.</p>

        <p>-  The City of San Francisco is one of the finest cities in the world. A world-class city.  It is a city whose destination is on the calendar and focus of travel plans from people across the globe.  Not just to tourist.  But they come to learn.  They come to study.  They come to grow.  They come to contribute.  They come to [experience] this great City and this ecumenical setting in one sense. And then there is this great ethnic complexion of the entire circle of humanity -- they come to compliment it.  And I think they do a great job in doing that.</p>

        <p>- Many businesses have come, as Commissioner Antonini, stated this afternoon, and many have gone.  Some of them have gone because the pressure has become to hard for them economically, or otherwise, for them to continue to do business and to transact the labors of distribution of goods or services in the City and County of San Francisco.  But yet, San Francisco still remains a great City.</p>

        <p>- Wanted to make a couple of observations because part of the beauty and part of the attractiveness of this City has been under siege.  We have seen that on too many occasions.  Small businesses found the city attractive and favorable and friendly.  Many of the small companies who come to do business, and many who have been doing business in the City for a long time no longer find it a palatable place for them to do business.  Yet in the mist of all of that, it becomes this Commission's responsibility to set land use policy and set other kinds of parameters in place so the person who wishes to do business, and continue to do business, can do so.  Not only to their growth and profit, but also to the growth and profit of this City, and then to the betterment of people.  I do not think we are making a good job in engaging the work force of the City.  In areas where it can be engaged, I think the administration has been a little less than supportive.  A far bit less than supportive of this.  We find out that those that are economically challenged and those residents from several communities--more specifically from African American communities--it often becomes more difficult without the support, the enhancement, and without the encouragement that comes from the civic administrative involvement for that community to continue to flourish, and continue to grow and be sustained.  Anything less than that, I think, is against it.  And I think this administration's policy needs to be a little bit more fine-tuned so they can begin to express themselves and direct themselves to meeting those needs.</p>

        <p>- Looking at what has happened in the last 5 months plus a few days, a week or so, since the engagement of this administration and its leadership.  We have not seen the same kind of vibrancy and the engagement of the totality of ethnic participation and availability in the City.  I do not think we have seen that done overtly as a goal or an aim at all.  It has been done pretty much to the contrary.  We have seen an exodus of African Americans from the civic engagements.  Certainly from Department Heads [positions].  And now, contrary to the City's Charter, we have learned and understand, even beyond what this Commission is supposed to do, that there has already been an announcement made that the Director for the Planning Department has been chosen.  And that decision has arrived without the engagement and without the direction of this Commission.  And I certainly believe personally, that the Charter calls for that [Commission's involvement], and provides for that.  If that is done here, I supposed it is done in many other places at the same time.  We are seeing African American Department Heads leave from several departments. We have seen members who have been employed in the City government leave from many places. We find out they're leaving is the cause of the diminishment of our presence here.  That it is unfriendly.  That is very unfavorable for such economically challenged communities.</p>

        <p>- Access to the leadership of this administration has been less than favorable. I see it personally as less than favorable when access is not available. There is no communication.  [We need the kind of communication that leads to] compromise and the kind of unified building, the engagement of resources of personal as well, for ideas to come in for the entire City.   It didn't start yesterday.  I think it started 5 months ago, and it is beginning to snow ball as it moves forward faster and faster.</p>

        <p>- My time with the Commission has been for a period of two years.  That period ends on June 30, 2004.  I would have assumed that I would receive a phone call to discuss what that all means.  Whether or not that would be an invitation to continue--and certainly that would be a matter to entertain--I may or may not consider to do so.  But I think that benefit should be offered to a person who serves in a capacity such as this.  Others have not been given the same kind of opportunity to express themselves.  And, while we make policy and set policies that governs the land use of this community, we need to realize, that there are those in this community who are from certain economic and ethnic groups who do not have the capability, nor the strength of power nor resources available to them, to be as aggressive as those who have that.  There is no one to speak on their behalf.  No one to actually promote and forward their needs.  Those who got, get more.  And those who have not, get even less.</p>

        <p>- I am less than impressed by the leadership of the City and this current administration. Based on that, I cannot in good consciousness, nor from moral feelings that are good, continue to serve.  And therefore, at the end of this Commission Comment period today I offer my resignation. I am asking you to deliver my resignation to the administration, and that resignation is effective at the close of this Commission's Comment period. </p>

        <p>- If by chance any comments that I made, or reflections, are unwanted, wrong, inconsistent or less than true, I both challenge and encourage the Mayor of this City to demonstrate actions to the contrary. </p>

        <p>- Last Tuesday, June 22, 2004, the Finance Committee heard the fee adjustment legislation that was before this Commission the previous Thursday. The Board heard it with the Planning Commission recommendations. They adopted the ordinance with the following change:  You had approved a $300.00 Discretionary Review fee, and a surcharge of $72.00 on permits over $10,000.  Because any increases in fees, would require additional notice, the Finance Committee could not adopt that increase in fees.  Similarly, to conform hourly fees to the $100.00 fee that you requested.  </p>

        <p>- Supervisor Peskin recommended dropping the $300.00 Discretionary Review fee to  $190.00 with the surcharge increased to $183.00.  [We] supported the idea [because] if we dropped the DR fee we have to increase the DR surcharge, and we already requested an increase in the DR surcharge to cover the smaller projects.</p>

        <p>- The full Board adopted most of the Commission's suggestions and, [he] believes, adopted the minor fee changes that have been advertised.</p>

        <p>- Wednesday, June 23, 2004, at the Budget Committee, we received Budget Analysts recommendations on the weekend, and had a serious of discussion with him.  We are largely in agreement with the changes.  However, we still need to work some things out. The recommendations are: to delete 6 vacant FTE that would save us $411,000.  We believe there is a miscommunication on what the vacant positions are. </p>

        <p>- The Budget Analyst wanted to delete one Planner IV -- we agreed with that, and the Budget Committee did make that motion to delete.  The Budget Analyst recommended that we modified our [salary] savings to reflect the fact that the new hires won't be until October.</p>

The total floor area of the new building would be about 73,224 gsf. The second through fifth floors would be set back between approximately 12 and 16 feet over the 13-1/2 foot tall podium of the ground floor. The proposed building would be approximately 50 feet tall. Pedestrian access would be provided from Treat Avenue while vehicular access would be provided from 18th Street to a ground level garage with 50 off-street parking spaces, a single loading space and six bicycle spaces.  The project site is in an M-1 (Light Industrial) Zoning District, and a 50-X height and bulk district.  It is also within the Eastern Neighborhoods study area.  </p>

          <p>SPEAKER (S):</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Kelly Saranger, Appellant</font> </p>

        </ul><p>- Our community is not against this project.</p>

        <p>- What we are opposed to is the potential for negative environmental effects because of the massive scale and size of this building.</p>

        <p>- There are 130 cubicle spaces, which are intended for various artists to use, pointed directly toward our building, which is a live-work space.  We are there 24/7, and there is the potential for air and water pollution because of these non-ventilated units as the current design suggests.  The only ventilation for these units is the window that is pointed toward us.  So we would assume that there would be fans that could blow fumes into our community.</p>

          <ul><p>-    Also concerned about the noise and traffic.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Bruce Cree, Appellant</font></p>

        </ul><p>- There will be negative environmental impacts. </p>

        <p>- The area where we are living is changing.  It is his opinion that if there are going to be more buildings, they should be built with the character of the existing building.</p>

          <ul><p>-     It is a very massive building.</p>

          <p>-     We as a community are not in favor of this kind of building.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Steve Vettel, representing Project Sponsor</font></p>

        </ul><p>- There is not a need for an EIR.</p>

          <ul><p>-     Urged the Commission to uphold the Negative Declaration.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Jillian Jerome</font></p>

          <ul><p>-    Should this project be constructed, it will cause serious damage to the garden.</p>

          <p>-     It is my opinion that the proposed project be submitted for an extensive EIR.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Michael Woo</font></p>

          <p>-  I am here to speak about concern for the air quality.</p>

          <p>-  Feels that they are going to build too many units.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Christina (last name unclear)</font></p>

          <p>-     Concerned about safety and health</p>

        </ul><p>- There is a huge brick wall that separates the Box Factory and the new project</p>

        <p>- This wall provides a lot of security and makes her place safe.</p>

          <ul><p>-     Fumes would be coming toward our place.</p>

          <p><font class="heading2">Ron Sland</font></p>

        <p>- Everyone who patronizes our establishment would like us to have some kind of entertainment.</p>

        <p>- We are a coffee shop/restaurant.  We serve Russian food and pastries.  We are not a dance club.</p>

        <p>- It is very hard to compete with the rest of the restaurants in the North Beach area.</p>

        <p>-     If we do not add to our establishment, we will simply be driven out.</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Brad Willmore, Telegraph Hill Dwellers. </font></p>

        </ul><p>- Adamantly opposed to this application.</p>

        <p>- Their liquor license is a type 41 that is specifically for a restaurant.  What we have is a bar--a techno bar.  They are not open for breakfast.  They are not open for lunch.  They are not always open for dinner.  In fact, they are not open most days of the week.  They are open on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights to skim the high value dollar traffic off of the bridge, tunnel, and BART crowd that come in to the Broadway Business District as well as the Grant Avenue Business District.</p>

        <p>- The Project Sponsor severely misrepresented his intentions when he appeared before our committee to get support/approval for a restaurant, and then shoe-horn that into a bar</p>

        <p>- We agree to the four-story project. It should have a setback of 15 feet in accordance with the Residential Design Guidelines.</p>

        <p>- The third story should be setback a little bit.</p>

        <p>- The adjacent property is only 2 stories.</p>

        <p>- It does not meet the residential guidelines</p>

        <p>- There is definitely a need for a construction management plan to be put into place that would restrict construction just to the weekdays, maybe 8 am to 4 pm.</p>

        <p>Preliminary Recommendation: Take Discretionary Review and Approve the Project with Modifications </p>

        <p>SPEAKER (S)</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Recina Wong - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <p>- The subject project is too tall.</p>

        <p>-     Such tall buildings do not fit within the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>-     Also concerned about her privacy, noise and pollution.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Angel Hong - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <p>-    The proposed project scale is not comparable with the rest of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>-    Concerned about her privacy.</p>

        <p>-    Parking has always been a major issue.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Joseph Corderio</font></p>

        <p>-    Supports Discretionary Review.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Dennis Budd, Project Sponsor</font></p>

        <p>- Majority of the homes in our neighborhood are two-stories, averaging 22' to 25' in height at the street fa&ccedil;ade.</p>

        <p>- There are 4 large trees in the area of the backyard where Planning had recommended we do a horizontal addition.</p>

        <p>- A horizontal addition would require twenty-five lineal feet of 6' high retaining wall on both property lines.</p>

        <p>- A horizontal addition would eliminate the light, air and rear-yard views from our current kitchen and family room.</p>

        <p>- We have signatures of support from 24 neighbors</p>

        <p>- We have reviewed the published Residential Design Guidelines and find that our project conforms in the following ways:</p>

          <ul><p>o Providing mixed visual character and architectural style</p>

          <p>o Providing setback height</p>

          <p>o Minimizing impacts on light and privacy</p>

          <p>o Preserving the lot and block pattern</p>

          <p>o Maintaining mid-block open space </p>

        </ul><p>ACTION: The Commission stated that the top story was unacceptable and directed the sponsor to explore options that would eliminate the top floor and find another location for the displaced floor area.  The matter was continued to September 23, 2004 by a vote +5 -0.</p>
