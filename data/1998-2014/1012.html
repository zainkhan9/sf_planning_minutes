          proposed new construction of 87 affordable housing units, 41 off-street 
          parking spaces (including 3 spaces for the City CarShare Program), a 
          3,500 square foot childcare facility, a community room, multi-purpose 
          room and offices associated with the residential use, 2,000 square feet 
          of retail space, and one freight-loading space. The proposed project 
          would consist of three separate buildings: one building would be three-stories 
          tall, or approximately 40 feet in height; a second structure would be 
          five-stories tall, or approximately 50 feet in height; and the third 
          structure would be eight-stories tall, or approximately 80-feet tall. 
          The proposed structures would contain approximately 128,000 gross square 
          feet. The site is approximately 30,948 square feet in size and located 
          at the northeast corner of Broadway and Battery Streets, with additional

          site is vacant. The site was also the former site of the Embarcadero 
          Freeway off-ramp, and is owned by the City and County of San Francisco.

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhood Meeting</i></p>

        <p>- He also thought that the meeting was very effective and is just the start of this process.</p>

        <p>- There will be meetings in the future with reactions to what is presented.</p>

        <p>- Staff will be announcing when the next meeting will be.</p>

        <p>- He also thanked staff as well.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Planning Director's absence for the March 13, 2003 Hearing</i></p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re:  1338 Filbert Street - Landmark of Cottages</i></p>

        <p>- It was discovered that one of the four cottages (Lot 31) was under a separate ownership and there was a question about whether that owner was properly noticed.</p>

        <p>- The committee therefore divided the ordinance in two: the first part dealt with 3 of the 4 cottages (specifically lots 32, 33 and 34).  They were passed out of committee and was approved on first reading by the full board on Tuesday, March 4.</p>

        <p>- The second part of the ordinance dealt with the fourth cottage (Lot 32) which is under separate ownership.  This will be considered at the March 17<sup>th</sup> meeting of the Land Use committee.  Both items are expected to be heard at the Full Board's meeting of March 18 and as a technical matter, the Board may decide to join both ordinances when considering the matter.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Conditional Use Appeal for 1193 Oak Street</i></p>

        <p>- This appeal was heard by the Commission on January 9, 2003.  It consists of a project to establish a bed and breakfast inn within the second floor dwelling unit.  A public hearing on the appeal was held and the item was continued for three weeks and will be heard once again at the March 25 meeting of the Board of Supervisors.  Questions were raised by members of the Board about the possible loss of housing if this CU were upheld, and about the eviction history at this address.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  1250 Haight Street</i></p>

        <p>The Land Use Committee approved the package of legislation that essentially amends the Planning Code and Zoning maps to create the Haight Street Senior Affordable Housing Special Use District.</p>

        <p>- The Commission had approved the Conditional Use application for this 40-unit affordable senior housing project by the Citizen Housing corporation pending the final adoption by the approval by the full Board, which will consider the items for first reading on March 17, 2003.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Conditional Use Revocation Ordinance by Supervisor Gonzalez</i></p>

        <p>- The Land Use Committee also approved Supervisor Gonzalez's ordinance allowing for the revocation of a Conditional Use authorization upon finding that the applicant provided false information in obtaining the Conditional Use.  The Land Use Committee also incorporated this Commission's recommendations with amendments that clarify what constitutes &quot;false information&quot; that could justify revocation of Conditional Use approval and by setting a time period of one year to receive such information from the effective date of the Conditional Use authorization.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Cancelled Meetings</i></p>

        <p>- The Land Use Committee and the Full Board meeting are cancelled next week as many members of the Board will be in Washington DC to attend a local legislators' conference.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Dog Patch Historic District.</i></p>

        <p>- The Land Use Committee will consider the legislation establishing the Dog Patch Historic District which has already been passed by the Landmark's Advisory Board and the Planning Commission on March 24, 2003.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Alcohol Restricted Use District</i></p>

        <p>- The Land Use Committee will also consider another ordinance that has been considered by this Commission, which is Supervisor Maxwell's legislation creating a Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District.  This would prohibit any new liquor establishments and would regulate existing non-conforming liquor establishments in this new Restricted Use District.</p>

        <p>- There was extensive damage to the property.  That is the reason for the demolition.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Barbara Dim - Discretionary Review Requestor</font></p>

        <p>- She objects to the project because the project sponsor mentioned that she was not going to make any changes to deal with any of the neighbors issues like fire safety, air quality from barbecue fumes, smoke odors, and noise.</p>

        <p>- She is also concerned that barbecuing on two decks would increase the possibility of fire.</p>

        <p>- She would like to have Plexiglas panels across the front of the deck to reduce and deflect noise, sound and direct smoke upwards.</p>

        <p>- She submitted support letters for Discretionary Review from various neighbors.  Some of the neighbors were not contacted by the project sponsor.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Mr. Dim </font></p>

        <p>- He displayed photographs displaying the height relationship of the buildings in question.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(+) Pamela Dubier</font></p>

        <p>- She just wants to add decking to her home.  The decking could have been made a lot bigger, but she was considerate of her neighbors.</p>

        <p>- The proposed decking does not block views, destroy green space, or decrease light or air flow.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Did not take Discretionary Review and approved the project.</p>
