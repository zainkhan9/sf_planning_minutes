        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner W. Lee:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Hunter's Point Shipyard project</i></p>

        <p>- This project was heard last week.</p>

        <p>- The next day after the case was approved, there was an article in the newspaper stating that many of the speakers who testified on this case received $10.00 for their testimony.</p>

        <p>- To his understanding those who were paid did not testify.</p>

        <p>- Those people did not have any bearing on their (the Commission's) vote to approve the project.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Cases at the Planning Department</i></p>

        <p>- He received information from sponsors stating that some projects have been filed with payment since June and these have still not been assigned a planner.</p>

        <p>- He wants to know how many projects have been filed with payment and have not been assigned a planner.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>3. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Re: Balboa Plan from Better Neighborhoods</i></p>

        <p>- The RFP is out and the closing date for that is December 28, 2004.  Staff will hold interviews and make a selection by January 7, 2005.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Merging of Computers between DBI and Planning</i></p>

        <p>- It is important to do this efficiently.</p>

        <p>- There was a meeting last week to prepare for taking the first steps of this merger.</p>

        <p>- This housekeeping matter will improve the computer systems.</p>

        <p>- A third party will be hired to analyze both systems and determine how they should be merged.</p>

    </ul></ul><p>4. Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">BOS - </font></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Land Use Committee</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District</i></p>

        <p>- The Committee supported legislation that imposes Conditional Use on formula retail in the Haight Street Neighborhood Commercial District.  The Committee voted unanimously to recommend this legislation to the full Board of Supervisors.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Hunters Point Redevelopment Plan</i></p>

        <p>- This had its first reading last Tuesday and will have its second reading this coming Tuesday.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Interim Controls on Lower Potrero Hill and Showplace Square</i></p>

        <p>- This item was also unanimously recommended to the full Board but with a few changes:</p>

        <p>1) Projects in the pipeline prior to November 23, 2004, will be allowed to continue with their environmental review; 2) ensure that there is a draft EIR by December 1, 2005; 3) hold committee hearings every eight weeks on the Department's progress and two weeks prior to these committee hearings the Department must submit a detailed progress report; 4) To update the 1998 economic analysis.  Staff has told the Board that this analysis will be completed in 90 days.  This analysis will be incorporated into the Land Use Analysis of San Francisco's diverse PDR sectors in lower Potrero Hill.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Ordinance to Recover Costs for EIRs:</i></p>

        <p>- This item went to the Finance Committee.</p>

        <p>- It is now sponsored by Supervisor McGoldrick.</p>

        <p>- This ordinance sets up a process where the total cost incurred by the Department in preparing an area plan, including the cost of an EIR, is associated with that area plan.  The total cost of that area plan is then divided by the number of the maximum build out alternatives analyzed in the EIR.</p>

        <p>- The hope is to recover 100%.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">BOA - </font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  144 Willard North Street</i></p>

        <p>- The Commission heard this on May 27, 2004.</p>

        <p>- The Commission disapproved the project. </p>

        <p>- The Board of Appeals voted to overturn the Commission's denial.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Explanation of DBI Code on fire escapes</i></p>

        <p>- He has requested this information from DBI.  It will be in Commissioner's packets next week.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">D. GENERAL</font> <font class="heading2">PUBLIC COMMENT - 15 MINUTES</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Bob Wheeler</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Board of Appeals item</i></p>

        <p>- He attended the Board of Appeals meeting last night.</p>

        <p>- He testified and made a request for jurisdiction for the property under construction at 193 Lower Terrace.</p>

        <p>- The Board acknowledged that there was a problem and will be researching this week.</p>

        <p>- He is requesting that the two building permits that have been issued be suspended and that a third permit be filed for the work underway.</p>

        <p>- The neighbors have not had a chance to voice their concerns about the true scope of the construction.</p>

        <p>- The building currently under construction violates the Planning Code.  The neighbors have a right to know the true scope of work.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">David Cornheim - Central City Progressive</font></p>

        <p>- The MTA is suggesting a parcel tax.</p>

        <p>- People are very concerned with the widening of MLK Drive.</p>

        <p>- Criminal action should be taken against the people who were paid to testify for the Hunter's Point Shipyard projects.</p>

        <p>- He would like to see the legislation on chain stores approved.</p>

        <p>- He and many neighbors are against the Albertson's on Fulton and Masonic.</p>

        <p>- He proposes a ban on this site because there should not be chain stores.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Kate White</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  Dean Macris</i></p>

        <p>- She welcomed Dean Macris to the Department and thanked him for accepting the position.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  18<sup>th</sup> and Alabama</i></p>

        <p>- She asked for the status of this project.</p>

        <p>- The Housing Coalition endorsed this project because it is in a transit rich location.  The project includes a large PDR component and has extensive neighborhood support.</p>

        <p>- The failure of Proposition A has left affordable housing with the question of whether it can be funded.</p>

        <p>- Citizens Housing has a deadline and she is concerned that the EIR will delay the project.</p>

        <p>- This project has tremendous consensus.  Citizens Housing has a great track record.</p>

        <p>- She encouraged the Commission to find out about this.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

        <p>- She asked staff about the status of this project.</p>

          <ul><p><font class="heading2">Acting Director Macris responded:</font></p>

          <p>- Staff is trying to find out a way to move this project forward.</p>

          <p>- Staff will provide information on the status of this project next week.</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">E. PUBLIC COMMENT ON AGENDA ITEMS WHERE THE PUBLIC HEARING HAS BEEN CLOSED</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>At this time, members of the public who wish to address the Commission on agenda items that have already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the public hearing has been closed, must do so at this time.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  1353-1355 Bush Street and 835 Hyde Street</i></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Randy Shaw - Director of the Tenderloin Housing Clinic</font></p>

    <p>- This is a very important project to approve.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">David Brown</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Karla Rossi - Property Manager of a Building on Sutter Street</font></p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Robert Garcia - Save Our Streets</font></p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p>333 FREMONT STREET - <font class="heading2">Public Hearing on Draft Environmental Impact Report</font> - Assessor's Block 3747, Lot 19 - The proposed project is an 85-foot-tall, eight-story, residential building of approximately 131,340 gross square feet (gsf) consisting of 88 dwelling units and about 88 underground parking spaces. Two existing two-story buildings on the site, which total approximately 30,417 square feet, would be demolished. The 329-333 Fremont Street building, constructed in approximately 1930, contains a basement level, which is accessible from a driveway on Zeno Place.  The smaller, 347-349 Fremont Street Edwin W. Tucker &amp; Co. building constructed in 1913 is a rated historic structure on the California Register of Historic Resources.  The project site is located about mid-block on the eastern side of Fremont Street in the block bounded by Folsom, Fremont, Harrison, and Beale Streets.  Vehicular access to the parking garage would be from Fremont Street on the northern side of the building.  Pedestrian access would be from the south side of the building from a courtyard facing Fremont Street.  The site is within the existing Rincon Hill Special Use District/Residential Sub-District, the RC-4 (Residential/Commercial High-Density) zoning district, and a 200-R height/bulk district, and within the proposed Rincon Hill Mixed Use District, and the proposed 350-R height/bulk district.</p>

        <p>- They do not agree with the entire plan.  There is much of it that is good.</p>

        <p>- This project is pedestrian oriented.</p>

        <p>- The project does not include family units.</p>

        <p>- The EIR should provide for an alternative floor plan.</p>

        <p>- It is important that the family units be mapped as 3-bedroom units.</p>

        <p>- The project should allow owners the freedom to rent out the third unit as a stand alone 1 bedroom unit, until such time as the owner would need the third bedroom to accommodate an expanding family unit or other needs.</p>

              <ul><ul><ul><p>1) On Page 5, Finding D, language should be deleted and the following language shall be added:  Project would be beneficial addition to the Northern Waterfront.  Project would not provide any on site residential open spaces.  The only location to do so would be on the roof which would require extensive and infeasible structural and elevator upgrades.  Instead, Project Sponsor has agreed to work with the City to provide an appropriate open space solution to address the increase demand for open spaces by project residents.</p>

              <p>2) Add the following Condition:  Project Sponsor shall provide or cause to be provided nearby open space or improve nearby open space in lieu of the approximately 5,700 sf of common required on site residential open space, in a manner to be reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator or demonstrate infeasibility of doing so to the Zoning Administrator.  The Zoning Administrator shall report to the Planning Commission how the Project Sponsor plans to meet this condition prior to the issuance of the site and building permits.</p>
