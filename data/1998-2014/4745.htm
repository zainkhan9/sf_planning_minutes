Residential/Service Mixed Use District (RSD) and a 40-X/85-B Height and Bulk District. 
<STRONG>An
Appeal of a Preliminary Negative Declaration (PND)</STRONG> published on July 25, 1998,
for a
proposed project consisting of new construction of 68 live/work units up to 142 dwelling
units, approximately 2,600 square feet of ground floor retail space, and 190 parking spaces
within an 85-foot tall, eight-story (plus two mezzanine levels), approximately 390,300 gross
square-foot building on an approximate 55,770 square-foot site.  A paved parking lot
currently occupies the project site.  The project would require Conditional Use Authorization
by the Planning Commission for the proposed height, building bulk, and parking greater
than the accessory use amount.  (Since the PND was published, the project sponsor has
revised the project to consist of 200 dwelling units instead of 68 live/work units and 142
dwelling units.  Hence, a Variance from the rear yard requirement would need to be granted
by the Zoning Administrator.)</FONT></P>
