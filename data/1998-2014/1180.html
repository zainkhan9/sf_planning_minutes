  <ul><p>5. Commission Comments/Questions</p>

    <ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

    <p>- He welcomed Dean Macris taking THE role as acting director.</p>

    <p>- He thanked Mayor Newsom for his own swearing in.</p>

    <p>- He thanked everyone who has supported him as a Commissioner.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Bradford Bell:</font></p>

    <p>- The Commission will adjourn in memory of Commissioner Antonini's Father:  Joseph Antonini who passed away at the age of 90.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  342 21<sup>st</sup> Avenue</i></p>

    <p>- She received a letter from the office of the Discretionary Review requestor regarding the revised plans submitted by the developer and that they are not similar to the ones approved by the Commission.</p>

      <ul><p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:</i></p>

      <p>- He had an opportunity to speak with Steve Williams before the hearing today and he also had a discussion with the Commissioners whether in fact the Commission wanted to eliminate the possibility of eliminating the third unit.</p>

      <p>- He felt that this was what the Commission intended to do.</p>

      <p>- He spoke to the Project Sponsor and is not sure if the plan is to cancel the project or submit revisions.</p>

      <p>- Right now, it is premature to deny it.</p>

    </ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

    <p>Re:  755 22<sup>nd</sup> Avenue</p>

    <p>- She received a request to schedule this.</p>

    <p>- She believes that the vote was +2-3.</p>

      <ul><p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:</i></p>

      <p>- He would have to check with the City Attorney or the Commission Secretary.</p>

      <p><i>Commission Secretary responded:</i></p>

      <p>- Unless the project is still at the Planning Department, the Commission does not have a mechanism to revisit this.</p>

      <p><i>City Attorney responded:</i></p>

      <p>- If it is in the Department, it could be called back.</p>

    </ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Sue Lee:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Open December 16, 2004 as a regular meeting</i></p>

    <p>- There will be a quorum so cases can be scheduled.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Olague:</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  4<sup>th</sup> Vote</i></p>

    <p>- When the Commission does not have a 4<sup>th</sup> vote, what would this mean to the Commission or the project presenters.</p>

      <ul><p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner responded:</i></p>

      <p>- In the case of Discretionary Reviews, where the project is in conformance with the Planning Code and someone is requesting that the Commission use their special DR policy and the Commission does not do that because there is no 4<sup>th</sup> vote, then the project is considered approved unless it is continued to a future date.</p>

      <p>- In the case of Conditional Use or other types of cases, where the project requires an approval by the Planning Commission to go ahead, if there is no 4<sup>th</sup> vote, the project is disapproved, unless there is a request to continue to a future date.</p>

      <p><i>Commission Secretary responded:</i></p>

      <p>- On the Conditional Use only:  Unless there are findings before the Commission, for this opposite action, then it has to be considered as an intent to disapprove. Findings would then need to come to the Commission before there is a final action.</p>

  </ul></ul><p>6. Discussion and consideration of possible action to amend the Rules and Regulations of the San Francisco Planning Commission to:</p>

      <ul><ul><p>&#183; Amend the Order of Business to consider moving Public Comment from the end of the calendar to another area on calendar;</p>

      <p>&#183; To define consent calendar procedures for those projects not in Neighborhood Commercial and South of Market districts, which already have procedures set forth under Planning Code 316; and</p>

    </ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Tony Kelley - Potrero Boosters</font></p>

    <p>- He agrees with moving public comment to the beginning of the calendar.</p>

    <p>- Perhaps having it at a certain time might be an idea.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Nilka Julio - Local 21</font></p>

    <p>- Restoring public comment to a time certain would be best.</p>

    <p>- A fixed and limited time would go a long way to have better communication between the Planning Commission and the public.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Gloria Williams</font></p>

    <p>- She would like to have a time specific time for public comment.</p>

    <p>- Or perhaps having several periodic times for public comment.</p>

    <p>- Even though there is the opportunity to email or write comments, there are some issues that are just very important.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">William Hall</font></p>

    <p>- He is from the Apollo Hotel.</p>

    <p>- Public comment should be in the afternoon and not late at night.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Patrick Waterman</font></p>

    <p>- Having public comment at the end of the calendar is an inconvenience for a lot of people.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">James Collins</font></p>

    <p>- He is from Mission Agenda.</p>

    <p>- Public comment should be held at the beginning of the hearing.  There are many people that are disabled and cannot stay to speak at the end of the hearing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Joe Shipman</font></p>

    <p>- He is a member of the Carpenter's Union.</p>

    <p>- It is extremely difficult to stay until the end of the meetings to be able to speak during public comment.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Richard Marquez</font></p>

    <p>- Many people have had to wait hours and hours to speak on a matter that is important to them.</p>

    <p>- It is important to protect the precious right to speak during public comment but at the beginning of the calendar.</p>

    <p>- Please move forward with public comment at the beginning of the meetings.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bruce Allison</font></p>

    <p>- Public comment should be split into two parts - one at the beginning and one at the end.</p>

    <p>- Another idea would be to set up a hot line for people to call and give their comments on an item.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sylvia Flores</font></p>

    <p>- She is a mother of three and lives in a small place where the rent is quite high.</p>

    <p>- She would like the Planning Department to create homes where there is affordable rent.</p>

    <p>- It is very difficult for her to come here and give her testimony.</p>

    <p>- It is important to have public comment at the beginning of the agenda.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sean Williams</font></p>

    <p>- He is with Mission/6<sup>th</sup> Street Agenda.</p>

    <p>- It is frustrating to come to the meetings and wait so long to be able to speak.</p>

    <p>- People have a lot of things to do during the day.</p>

    <p>- People should be able to speak first.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bruce Wolfe</font></p>

    <p>- He is a social worker and a person with a disability.</p>

    <p>- It is very difficult for many people to wait for long periods of time.</p>

    <p>- He realizes that it is also difficult for the Commission to stay at the meeting for long periods of time.</p>

    <p>- It is important to have public comment at the beginning of the meeting.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Chuck Choy</font></p>

    <p>- He supports moving public comment to the beginning of the hearing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Antonio Diaz</font></p>

    <p>- He is with PODER and MAC.</p>

    <p>- He would like to reinstate public comment at the beginning of the meeting.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Cris Durazo</font></p>

    <p>- He is from the SOMA Community Action.</p>

    <p>- Public comment should be moved to the beginning.</p>

    <p>- Many people she works with do not have the opportunity to come to the hearings.</p>

    <p>- Not everything that the Commission does is project approval.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Charles Marsteller</font></p>

    <p>- He thanked the Commission for taking this issue up.</p>

    <p>- The Board of Supervisors suspends the rules at 3:00 to pick up a fixed agenda.  This might be a good idea for the Planning Commission.  This time can be limited.  The number of people can be limited also.</p>

    <p>- This would eliminate people having to be here all day.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Norman Rolf</font></p>

    <p>- He urges the Commission to move public comment to the beginning of the agenda.</p>

    <p>- One of the reasons is to have the Commission hear from the public.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Mary Ann Miller</font></p>

    <p>- She is speaking for SPEAK.</p>

    <p>- They are among one of many neighborhood groups that would like to come to speak at the hearing.</p>

    <p>- Having public comment at the beginning of the agenda would be ideal.</p>

    <p>- During the previous Commission, the public comment period was never abused.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bill Murphy</font></p>

    <p>- He is a third generation San Franciscan predominantly in the Mission District.</p>

    <p>- There have been a lot of changes and many do not look good.</p>

    <p>- People that live here have a say.  Being able to come to the hearing and speak at the beginning would be ideal.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Chris Cole</font></p>

    <p>- Everywhere procedures are used that are fair.</p>

    <p>- People that have spoken here today cannot come to speak at the end of the hearing.</p>

    <p>- People should be able to speak at the beginning of the calendar.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sue Hestor</font></p>

    <p>- If there has not been any valuable information said during public comment that is because it happens so late that no one comes.</p>

    <p>- Public comment should be allowed at the beginning of the calendar.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Azalia Merrell</font></p>

    <p>- The public will be best served by having public comment at the beginning and at the end of the calendar.</p>

    <p>- There are many people that work during the day and can speak at the end of the calendar and there are elderly and disabled people that do not go out in the late afternoon.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jim Salinas</font></p>

    <p>- This Commission has taken great steps to have good communication between themselves and the public.</p>

    <p>- People do work and most people work until 5:00 p.m.</p>

    <p>- Public comment is set aside for items that are not on the agenda.</p>

    <p>- There are drawbacks on both sides so there is no ideal situation.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jeremy Nelson</font></p>

    <p>- He agrees that having public comment is best at the beginning therefore they are able to use public transportation or walk to the hearing.</p>

    <p>- If public comment is at the end, it causes them to drive or to not come at all.</p>

    <p>- Having two certain times for public comment would be best.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">ACTION on point one:</font></p>

    <p>1) Put a public comment category at the beginning of the calendar - right before the regular calendar category with a maximum time of 15 minutes-[i.e. five speakers could have up to three minutes each].</p>

    <p>2) Keep the public comment category for closed items.</p>

    <p>3) Keep the public comment category at the end of the calendar.</p>

    <p>4) Commission to review in six months.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

    <p>- Consider having a hearing to discuss the canceled 5<sup>th</sup> Thursday and there is a holiday, it impedes having a hearing.</p>

    <p>- This should be done during the second hearing of January 2005.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Commission Secretary:</font></p>

    <p>- She reminded the Commission that the packet information provided to them for the November 4 hearing, which was cancelled and continued to November 29, is still current.  She recommended that they not misplace this information.</p>

    <p>- The Eastern Neighborhoods EIR is paramount.</p>

    <p>- Staff needs to find a way to provide good solid information to the Commission.</p>

    <p>- He has talked to the firm ESA, who is responsible for the EIR, and they have assured him that they will give the Eastern Neighborhoods EIR top priority.</p>

    <p>- There are actions at the Board of Supervisors that need to be dealt with as well, like Supervisor Maxwell's interim controls legislation.</p>

    <p>- The most affected agencies in City government should be involved in the decision making process in terns of the departments to bring to the Commission it's solid thinking.</p>

    <p>- A team is being formed that includes, The Office of Economic Development, The Office of Housing, The Port Director and the Redevelopment Director, to discuss the issue of some of the immediate pressures of PDR.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  Search for New Director</i></p>

    <p>- He has talked to the Committee of the Commission and would like to meet individually with the Commissioners about that.</p>

    <p>- A search firm has been nominated to help with finding a new director.</p>

    <p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner stated:</i></p>

    <p>Re:  19<sup>th</sup> and Oakwood Project</p>

    <p>- This is a condominium project that was approved many years ago.</p>

    <p>- The project was sold to a different developer and modifications were made to it.</p>

    <p>- Was this in general conformity with the approval?</p>

    <p>- He asked the developer to conduct community meetings and to speak with the Supervisor of that district.</p>

    <p>- On September 29, he issued a letter of determination finding this project in general conformity with the conditions that the Commission approved.</p>

    <p>- The letters were appealed.  This is scheduled for hearing on January 19.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  724 Van Ness Avenue</i></p>

    <p>- The Commission approved this project about two years ago.</p>

    <p>- Project Sponsor filed a permit to provide 110 units.  There were some concerned citizens.</p>

    <p>- He issued a letter that going from 144 units to 110 units was in general conformity.</p>

    <p>- The owner came back and stated he would do 132 units.</p>

    <p>- He stated orally that he could support this and he would like to see the plans.</p>

    <ul><p><font class="heading2">BOS - </font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Eastern Neighborhoods</i></p>

    <p>- There are various processes going on with this.</p>

    <p>- The Rules Committee passed out of Committee Supervisor Daly's resolution that establishes a 22 member western SOMA citizen's planning task force.</p>

    <p>- Senior Planner Paul Lord was present at this hearing.</p>

    <p>- The Land Use Committee will hear this coming Monday, Supervisor Maxwell's resolution imposing interim controls on certain lots within the Showplace Square area.</p>

    <p>- Interim Controls that are initiated by the Board do not go before the Commission.  If the Land Use Committee passes this it will go directly to the full Board.</p>

    <p><i>Interim Director Macris commented:</i></p>

    <p>- He attended the South of Market Leadership Council Meeting.</p>

    <p>- He was very impressed with the diversity of the members who attended.</p>

    <p>- Paul Lord accompanied him and they expressed their support regarding planning in their area.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  New Legislation:</i></p>

    <p>- On the full Board, Supervisor Maxwell's legislation regarding establishing a task force to establish PDR businesses was passed.  The task force will be comprised of nine members.</p>

    <p>- PDR businesses pay higher wages and offer entry-level workers an opportunity for advancement.</p>

    <p>- It is important to bring these businesses back to San Francisco.</p>

    <p><i>Zoning Administrator Badiner commented:</i></p>

    <p>- He attended the Finance Committee where the Mills Act contract for 690 Market was heard.</p>

    <p>- The Commission heard this project.  The question now is about the financing and/or adding a tax increment.</p>

    <p>- What part of the project does the Mills Action act upon?</p>

    <p>- This was continued at the call of the chair.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">BOA -</font></p>

    <p><i>Re:  Burlington Coat Factor - 599 Howard Street</i></p>

    <p>- This was approved for a conversion to an office project.</p>

    <p>- The academy of science has moved into the building in the interim.</p>

    <p>- The project sponsor requested a letter asking if the office entitlement carries forward on this.  His initial reaction was no.</p>

    <p>- After some discussion with staff, it was agreed that this was a unique situation.</p>

    <p>- Ms. Hestor appealed this.</p>

    <p>- It was heard last night and the Board upheld the ZA's determination.</p>

    <p>- One of Ms. Hestor's concerns was accuracy and correctness of keeping the annual limit lists up to date.</p>

    <p><i>Re:  572 San Jose Avenue</i></p>

    <p>- The Commission heard this.</p>

    <p>- The Commission felt that this was a demolition and denied the project.</p>

    <p>- The Board voted +3-2 to deny the project.</p>

    <p>- Everyone believes that this project will come back before the Commission very soon.</p>
