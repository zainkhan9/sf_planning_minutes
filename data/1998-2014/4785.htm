<p>B. <b>PUBLIC COMMENT</b> <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of
interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the
Commission except agenda items. With respect to agenda items, your opportunity
to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the
meeting with one exception. When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a
public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the
Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the
Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.
Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes.
If it is demonstrated that comments by the public will exceed 15 minutes, the
President or chairperson may continue Public Comment to another time during the
meeting. <br>
&nbsp; </p>
<p>&quot;The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing
any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at
public comment. In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: </p>
<p>(1) responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the
public; or </p>
<p>(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or </p>
<p>(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda. (Government Code
