Supervisor Leno gave an example of a project that was approved recently by the Planning Commission that is located on Market and Polk.  Because the project did not require a Conditional Use permit, the inclusionary affordable housing was only five percent.  Supervisor Leno suggested that the Commission not approve projects that don't have inclusionary housing.  She believes that the supervisor is misinformed.  She knows that the Commission has most always approved projects that have at least 10 percent of inclusionary housing.  Since Supervisor Leno is misinformed, she would like to clarify the policy of this Commission to the supervisor.  She urges the Commission to expedite Commissioner Chinchilla's request about looking into the policies that cover inclusionary housing.<br><br>Commissioner Chinchilla:<br>He agrees that Supervisor Leno is misinformed.  The only reason that this Conditional Use was not applied to the project on Market and Polk Street is because there is a flaw in the policy.  He requests that the Planning Department review and potentially update the policy.  It might be a drafting error.<br><br>Commissioner Salinas:<br>He requested information on the timeline of projects that have inclusionary housing.  He is concerned that we have affordable housing that is in great demand but the process is not an expeditious one.  He would like the Department to provide Commissioners with the most current 30 projects and determine the timeline for each project.  The Commissioners are willing to help make this process an expeditious one.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>Larry Badiner (Acting Director)<br><br>Re:  Supervisor Leno's Concern:<br>It is not that the Commission is avoiding applying 10 percent affordability.  He agrees that there is a drafting error and this was carried into Supervisor Leno's current proposal.  The project located on Market and Polk did not require a Conditional Use so this was an exception.  Another question and/or issue would be that another potential requirement should be a variance.  Director Green has committed to having a hearing regarding these issues.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors (BOS) and Board of Appeals (BOA):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOS &ndash; None<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BOA - None<br><br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REGULAR CALENDAR<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2001.0669XCV&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(LIGHT: 558-6254)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;199 NEW MONTGOMERY STREET - east side between and with secondary frontages on Natoma and Howard Streets, Lot 21, in Assessor&rsquo;s Block 3722 -- Request under Planning Code Section 309 (Downtown Code) for Determinations of Compliance and Exceptions, including but not necessarily limited to: an exception to the Separation of Towers requirement (Section 132.1(c)); an exception to the Reduction of Ground Level Wind Current requirement (Section 148 (a)), and an exception to the rear yard requirement (Section 132.1); to construct a 150-foot tall, 16-story building containing approximately 168 dwelling units, ground floor retail, and 80 sub-grade parking spaces; The project lies within a C-3-O(SD) (Downtown, Office, Special Development) District and within a 150-S Height and Bulk District. This proposal replaces a previous project (2000.552BCVX) approved by the Planning Commission on February 15, 2001, that was for construction of a mixed-use building containing approximately 49,000 square feet of office, 99 dwelling units, ground level retail and 70 sub-grade parking spaces.   The office square footage that was approved under Section 321 of the Planning Code (Annual Office Limit) will now be available for other project applications for office projects containing less than 50,000 square feet.  The project is located in a C-3-O(SD) (Downtown Office, Special Development) District, and a 150-S Height and Bulk District.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation:  Approval with conditions.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SPEAKER(S):<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(+) Jim Reuben, Reuben and Alter<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Mr. Clark Manus will be presenting the project.  He will speak on affordable housing policies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- There is an ongoing public dialog regarding these policies.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- The current policy has been 10 percent for projects that require conditional use.

With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. <br>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: <br>(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or<br>(2)  requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or <br>(3)  directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.  (Government Code Section 54954.2(a))<br><br>Sue Hestor<br>Re:  311 Notice Process<br>- In the past month, she has had 3 cases where after notices were sent out, the plans went to DBI and they suggested changes to the plans.  She has been speaking to DBI, planning and BOS in order to try to get out of this impasse.<br>- If an expansion of the building envelope happens while the project is going through the approval process of DBI it should get another 311 Section notice.<br>- It is frustrating to have to deal with these cases when they are under construction or they are at the Board of Appeals.<br>- This needs to be dealt with and the Commission needs to be aware of how important this issue is.<br><br>Adjournment: 6:30 p.m.<br><br><br>THE DRAFT MINUTES ARE PROPOSED FOR ADOPTION AT THE REGULAR MEETING OF THE PLANNING COMMISSION ON THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 20, 2001.<br><br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Approved<br>PRESENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltimore, Chinchilla, Fay, Joe, Lim, Salinas<br>ABSENT:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Theoharis<br><br> <p>
