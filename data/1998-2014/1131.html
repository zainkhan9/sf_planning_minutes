He would like to address these questions.  This Commission makes good, solid decisions.  Regarding the IPZ (Bayshore Boulevard), he understands how it is important to move this agenda forward.  He doesn't believe that any one in this Commission has lost sight that housing is important.  <br><br>Commissioner Theoharis:  Citing personal reasons, she read a statement indicating her intent to resign in January.<br><br>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DIRECTOR'S REPORT<br><br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Director's Announcements<br><br>Re:  Budget<br>- Some parts of the Department's budget were not agreed to during the budget process.  This has resulted in a shortage of positions and a shortage of revenue.  Next week, he (the Director) will speak to the Mayor's budget analyst and the Finance Committee of the Board of Supervisors.  This budget item will again be placed on the calendar in the next few weeks.  <br><br>Re:  Planning Director's Conference in Cambridge, Massachusetts<br>- He attended this event last week.<br>- The purpose of this conference was to talk about the emerging issues in various cities.<br>- There was a very interesting presentation from a professor of the Harvard Design School titled:   Regulating the Good you Can't Think Of.   He will provide a copy of this presentation to the Commissioners.  The subject matter of this presentation is about zoning.<br><br>Re:  Commissioner Theoharis's intent to leave the Commission<br>- He will be sorry to see her leave.  Ms. Theoharis's contributions and efforts will be missed.<br><br>Re:  Reason Inclusionary Housing Item was continued:<br>- There were various questions that need to be dealt with and responded to.<br>- There has been a request from the Mayor's Office of Housing to consider other amendments that would make the policies of the department more effective.<br>- Time is required to be able to respond to these issues so a presentation will be scheduled at the hearing of October 18, 2001.<br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Review of Past Week's Events at the Board of Supervisors and Board of Appeals<br>BOS &ndash; Re:  Conditional Use at 4501 Irving Street <br>The Board of Supervisor altered the decision of the Commission by reducing the size of the project in terms of height and therefore reducing the number of units.  This project will have the same number of parking spaces but there will be a reduction in the amount of ground floor commercial space, a reduction of floors from four stories to three and therefore a reduction in the number of dwelling units--which would cause a reduction of affordable units.<br><br>Housing, Land Use and Transportation Committee<br>Re: 525 Golden Gate <br>- The amendment of the height proposal was before the committee.  This was moved to the full board by a vote of +2-1.<br><br>Re:  Dwelling Unit Merger Ordinance<br>- Paul Lord of department staff attended this hearing.<br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were interested on how this policy had been implemented and what actions had been taken.<br><br>BOA &ndash; None but the IPZ Special Use District will be before the Board of Appeals very soon.<br><br>D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CONSIDERATION OF FINDINGS AND FINAL ACTION -- PUBLIC HEARING CLOSED <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2000.272EXC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(LeBLANC: 558-6351)<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;185 POST STREET - the southeast corner of Post Street and Grant Avenue, Lot 18 in Assessor&rsquo;s Block 310 - CEQA Findings, and Request under Planning Code Section 309 for Determinations of Compliance for Building Permit Application No. 2001/05/30/0246S and Request for Exceptions including: (1) an exception to the rear yard requirement as permitted in Code Section 134(d); (2) an exception to ground level wind current standards as permitted in Section 148; (3) an exception to the base height limit in an 80-130-F Height and Bulk District as permitted in Section 263.8, (4) an exception to the required sun access angle (or setback) pursuant to Section 146(b) and (5) an exception to the freight loading requirements as permitted in Section 161(I).

Of these, 93% were relocated within San Francisco.  Ninety-one people were moved to their (the Housing Authority's) public housing stock and an additional 20 moved into private units run by Section 8 landlords in the City.<br>- This is an opportunity to use funds provided by HUD.  If these funds sit around too long, they could loose the money.<br>(+) Carol Galante &ndash; President of Rich Housing Corporation and Lead Developer for North Beach Development Associates<br>- They are very excited to work with the San Francisco Housing Authority.<br>- This permit is the last critical planning element to keep them on schedule to submit for the tax credit financing that they need to do.<br>- This tax credit leverages over $42 million of private tax credit equity, $25 million dollars of private financing and serves as the foundation for leveraging the hope six dollars which otherwise would be lost.<br>- The project also enables the City of San Francisco to make a commitment of close to $11 million dollars of local funding and reserve a tax credit for other affordable housing projects that are in the pipeline.<br>(+) Mike Johnson &ndash; M. Johnson Interests<br>- He has been working closely with the architects.<br>- He displayed photographs and diagrams describing the project.<br>(-) David Hesbett<br>- He is not opposed to the project.  He is just opposed to the way the Housing Authority has been dealing with the current residents.<br>- At first they said it would be done in phases and they keep changing the plans.  Now the plan is to do it in one phase so they will have to evict everyone at the same time.<br>(+) Waymond Nichols<br>- Potrero Hill was one of the first developments that had an opportunity to receive the Hope 6 funds, but they (the residents) were misguided.<br>- Then they began to look at Hayes Valley and then Bernal Heights but it was a bit too late.  There was no more money for Potrero Hill.<br>- No one would want to live at the old North Beach and not want to live at the new North Beach.<br>- He hopes that the Commission weighs all the evidence and makes the right decisions.<br>(+) Margarita Medina<br>- She has lived in the development since 1986.<br>- She would like to stay there and supports this project.<br>(+) Kimberly Hill Brown<br>- She is a Bernal dwelling resident and the residents are very pleased to have moved back.<br>- Hope 6 is a very stressful process on the residents.  She was displaced for 5 years and could have been displaced for less time but outsiders came into the development and caused delays for them.<br>- People have to be committed to Hope 6 since it's a very good project.<br>- She hopes that the Housing Authority works through the problems and keeps on schedule.<br>(-) Beverly Williams<br>- She lives in the North Beach development.<br>- The Housing Authority had promised them that the project would be done in two phases.

They opposed this since they resolved that it would be better to have the units rebuilt.<br>- The association has been working hard to help the residents of these units by helping them paint, offering jobs, etc.<br>- The residents were promised that this project would be in phases, yet the east block needs to be torn down in order for the residents to start believing that the City wants to go forward with this project.<br>(+) Sandra Gomez<br>- She supports the revitalization of North Beach.<br>- She lives in Bernal but is happy that her mother will be able to move back to North Beach.<br>- Many residents have been working closely with the Housing Authority.<br>(+) Daryl Higashi &ndash; Acting Director of the Mayor's Office of Housing<br>- They have been working very closely with the developers and the San Francisco Housing Authority over the last 5 years--from a concept process to a project that has all the elements of community planning and smart growth.<br>- Their office is very committed to provide a significant amount of financing to this project.<br>- The concept to move forward in one phase is very critical for low income housing tax credits.  These credits are very hard to obtain and they are very competitive.<br>- Having this project done in one phase will not only help the City but also help other communities receive the same benefits.<br>- He has high confidence that the residents will receive all the benefits they were promised when relocating temporarily. <br>(-) Rob Eshelman &ndash; Supervisor Gonzalez's Office<br>- The agreement was that the project would be done in two phases.  Then they changed the plans to be done in one phase.  This violates the agreement.<br>- Supervisor Gonzalez hopes that the project will be disapproved or continued until the issues being brought up by the residents are dealt with.<br>- The supervisor agrees that this is a good project yet it should be done in a matter that will not affect the residents negatively.<br>(-) Phillip Morgan &ndash; Staff Attorney at Bay Area Legal Aid<br>- These are the main points of the tenants:  1) the written contracts between the tenants and the housing authority say that the project will go forward in two phases; 2) the relocation plan which was developed with consultation with the tenants state that the project would take place in two phases. <br>- The tenants are hopeful of a new home, yet the problem is that they don't know who to trust or who to believe.<br>- He has issues with the conditions of approval.<br>(-) Lorraine Bender<br>- She has been a resident of North Beach for more than 20 years.<br>- She is stressed out, she is disappointed and she is sad.<br>- The plan was to do this construction in two phases and it keeps changing.<br>- All the residents participated in the plan and it should be respected.<br>- She hopes that the Commission will approve the project in two phases.<br>(-) Gen Fujioka &ndash; Asian Law Caucus<br>- The relocation plan document does not really address all the important information it should have required by law.<br>(-) King Fong<br>- He is against this development because the residents have been told lies.<br>- He doesn't believe that this project will go forward.<br>(-) Duck Nim<br>- There were about 14 residents who were not able to come today who are against this project.<br>- The developers of this project have not been honest with any of the residents.<br>(-) Fong, Yat King<br>- He is a taxicab driver and has lived in this project complex for 26 years. <br>- People say that this area is very dangerous yet he goes off of work in the early morning and has never had any problems.<br>- He does not believe that people need to move in order to have the area reconstructed.<br>- He believes that the developers are liars.<br>(-) Duc Nim<br>- He is a UC Berkley student.  He knows of about 14 residents who wanted to come to this hearing and speak against this project but because of different obligations could not make it.<br>- He and the 14 residents he is representing oppose this project because the Housing Authority lacks respect and duty to the residents. <br>- There are 5 issues they have which they would like to present to the Commission:  1) Sanitation--sewer pipes have never been repaired since the damage caused by the Loma Prieta Earthquake; 2) Security--residents have never been asked on how to improve security in the complex; 3) Education--thousands of dollars were offered for a computer training center but less than 20 classes were offered; 4) Finances--the residents were never informed about HUD's income disregard policy that began in 1994.  Participation and Decisions--they believe that residents should be involved in the Hope 6 redevelopment.<br>(-) Don Paul<br>- There are about 20 letters of support that were submitted to the Commission but he believes that these tenants were misinformed.<br>- He displayed photos of the problems that are visible in the complex.<br>- Residents never received an appraisal of the property's value in 1996.<br>- He believes that it is unnecessary to reconstruct the complex in one phase.<br>(-) Marie Harrison &ndash; Housing as a Human Right<br>- They would not be here had it not been because of a great cry from the remaining tenants and some tenants who have already left.<br>- They were asked to come in since the tenants believe that the Housing Authority is not being honest.<br>- The tenants must be full partners and they have not been.<br>- There were some tenants from other Hope 6 projects who were not allowed to come back and they are fighting for this not to happen again.<br>- Their office has received various complaints about the Housing Authority.<br>- It is not fair for the tenants to be brought back to the same size house since families grow and change throughout the years.<br>(-) Jose Arias<br>- He has the same problems as the previous tenants have spoken about.<br>(-) (Did not state name)<br>- She does not understand what is going on since some people tell them one thing and other people tell them another thing.<br>(-) Ana Mendoza<br>- She is opposed because she does not want to move.<br>- The tenants were promised that they would be able to stay while the construction is going on.<br>(-) Gloria Blanco<br>- At first they told the tenants that they did not have to move until they finished the building.  <br>- Now they want them to move and she is confused.<br>(-) Marilyn Dunman<br>- She has lived at North Beach Housing for 32 years.  She loves the neighborhood and loves to see things built.<br>- She does not know why the east block was not torn down a long time ago.<br>- She received various documents from the Housing Authority stating the procedure about the tenants moving out while the construction was going on.  Yet various things have been changing.<br>(-) Mary Berradori<br>- She was born at North Beach housing.<br>- She has a hard time seeing and she does not want to move.  She loves it there.  They promised them a lot of things.<br>(-) Wendy Tram<br>- She has lived at North Beach housing for 10 years.<br>- She would like to see a new North Beach but she would not like to move.  <br>-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything is so close for her and her family.<br>(-) Tory Budori<br>- He is so tired of all the lies and all the promises that they have offered the tenants.  <br>- Housing Authority should just build how they promised.<br>(-) Alma Larc<br>- She has lived at North Beach for a number of years.<br>- There is a law that requires development built near low income housing, to give a certain percentage of funds to that low income housing.<br>- During the Loma Prieta Earthquake the sewage lines were damaged.

The proposal would provide no rear yard space, but would provide 87 square feet of open space at the rear of the lot.  Section 135 requires that open space for dwelling units in the SLR District must be at least 36 sf in size, with at least 30 percent of its perimeter unobstructed, and face onto an open area of at least 15 feet in every horizontal dimension.  The proposed unit would have open space obstructed by a security gate and would face onto Decker Alley, which is only 10 feet wide.  Section 140 requires that all dwelling units face on an open area of at least 25 feet in width or a Code-complying rear yard.  The subject unit would meet this requirement only subject to the Zoning Administrator granting a rear yard variance.  Alternatively, the Zoning Administrator has the authority under Section 307(g) to grant exceptions from rear yard and open space requirements in South of Market Districts.  <br><br>SPEAKER(S):&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same as those listed in item 19a.<br>ACTION:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acting Zoning Administrator closed the public hearing and was inclined to grant variance but with the denial of the permit application, the variance decision is on hold until the Commission's decision is appealed and acted upon.<br><br>G.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PUBLIC COMMENT<br><br>At this time, members of the public may address the Commission on items of interest to the public that are within the subject matter jurisdiction of the Commission except agenda items.  With respect to agenda items, your opportunity to address the Commission will be afforded when the item is reached in the meeting with one exception.  When the agenda item has already been reviewed in a public hearing at which members of the public were allowed to testify and the Commission has closed the public hearing, your opportunity to address the Commission must be exercised during the Public Comment portion of the Calendar.  Each member of the public may address the Commission for up to three minutes. <br><br>The Brown Act forbids a commission from taking action or discussing any item not appearing on the posted agenda, including those items raised at public comment.  In response to public comment, the commission is limited to: <br><br>(1)  responding to statements made or questions posed by members of the public; or<br>(2) requesting staff to report back on a matter at a subsequent meeting; or <br>(3) directing staff to place the item on a future agenda.
