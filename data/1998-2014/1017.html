The area is accessed by Camp Mather Road off Highway 120.    The project consists of modifying the piping at O'Shaughnessy Dam that controls discharge to the existing 108-inch Canyon Power Tunnel pipeline (or penstock) at the base of the dam, and the downstream water transmission system. The piping modification involves construction of a new 60-inch pipeline to allow withdrawal of water from a higher level in the reservoir, to be used when turbidity in the reservoir is above the allowable level.  The project also involves demolition of the lower valve house.  The purpose of the project is to improve the water quality and water supply from Hetch Hetchy Reservoir to the City and Country of San Francisco and its water customers by constructing a second higher outlet to the aqueduct from the reservoir</p>

This project is proposed for land that is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the Department of Public Works (DPW) and is partially leased to a parking vendor.  The Board of Supervisors previously approved in principle the transfer of the property from DPW to the Mayor's Office of Housing for the development of affordable housing.  A General Plan Referral is needed at this time in order for the Board of Supervisors to consider (a) lease disposition and development agreement that will allow the affordable housing developer, Chinatown Community Development Center (Chinatown CDC), to move forward with development activities, and (b) a future ground lease between the City and Chinatown CDC to be entered into at the start of construction.  The subject property is zoned C-2 (Community Business), is in the Northern Waterfront S.U.D. No. 3, and in a 84-E Height and Bulk District.  </p>

    <p>10.  Commission Comments/Questions</p>

        <ul><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Antonini:</font></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p><i>Re:  Housing Element</i></p>

        <p>- Part of the housing element deals with public housing.</p>

        <p>- He read over the housing element but he is not sure if there is enough information on whether there is a Federal or State requirement on how much public housing should be built in relation to per capita or whether or not Section 8 type housing could be used as a substitute.  It is important to know if this particular type of housing fits into the scheme of things.  </p>

        <p>- The Commission will be making decisions based on inclusionary housing, based on affordable housing, based on for-profit housing, etc.  The Commission needs a bit more knowledge or background on the issue of public housing to properly make decisions on other housing questions.  He would like input from staff before the Housing Element is considered.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner William Lee</font></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p><i>Re:  Budget Update</i></p>

        <p>- He would like the status on the budget.</p>

        <p>- He would also like to know if there will be any lay-offs of staff.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Feldstein:</font></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p><i>Re:  Family Housing</i></p>

        <p>- She would like to see staff start incorporating this policy in projects before they come to the Commission so that developers will not feel they are being blindsided.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p><font class="heading2">Commissioner Boyd:</font></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p><i>Re:  Housing Components</i></p>

        <p>- He would like information on statistics that are available on the number of units that are being built in the City and how many of these are affordable and how many are market rate.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p>- What is the impact on rental housing?</p>

</ul></ul></ul></ul><p><font class="heading2">C. DIRECTOR'S REPORT</font></p>

    <ul><ul><p>11. Director's Announcements</p>

        <ul><ul><p><i>Regarding Commissioner William Lee's comment:</i></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p>- He is still in discussion with the Mayor's office regarding the budget so there is nothing to report.</p>

        <p>- Regarding layoffs:  The Planning Department does not plan to have any terminations, layoffs, etc. through the next fiscal year.  Additional instructions from the Mayor's office are being met without any layoffs.  If the Department had to employ some new program, he would come before the Commission first to receive input.</p>

        </blockquote><ul><p><i>Regarding Commissioner Feldstein's comment:</i></p>

        </ul><blockquote><p>- The requests from Commissioner Feldstein regarding car shares, family housing, etc.:  The Commission has the authority to change a project as they see fit.</p>

        <p>- It is the responsibility of staff to let developers, lawyers, public, etc. be aware of Commissioner's concerns.</p>

        <p>- The process to deal with these issues is developing.  It is not something that will happen overnight but the process is definitely moving forward.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Jean Paul Samaha gave the following report:</font></p>

        <p><i>Re:  1193 Oak Street</i></p>

        <p>- The Board overturned the Planning Commission on a +10-1 vote, with Supervisor Hall dissenting.  The Board felt that it was a loss of housing even though the tenant remained in the dwelling unit, and that it was a bad precedent to set.</p>

        <p><i>The following items passed unanimously on the first reading:</i></p>

        <p>1)  Rezoning of King and Townsend Streets (601 King Street)</p>

        <p>2) Designation of the Dogpatch Historic District</p>

        <p>3) Third Street Alcohol Restricted Use District</p>

        <p>On April 7, the Land Use Committee will hear 2161 Sutter Street - Zoning Map Change.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">Robert Wales</font></p>

        <p>- This case has been continued much too many times.</p>

        <p>- He would like to have this case heard today.</p>

        <p><i>Re:  Merits of the Case</i></p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Robert Wales</font></p>

        <p>- He lives on Beach Street.</p>

        <p>- He is less than 100 feet from these proposed antennas.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned about the radiation, reduction of property values, etc.</p>

        <p>- He contacted Verizon Wireless about the noise that will be heard during the installation and they were not very helpful.</p>

        <p>- He can think of various locations where these antennas can be placed where they are not close to people's homes and people's bedrooms.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Erika Tarantino</font></p>

        <p>- He is aware of various neighbors who were not able to come and who are against these antennas.</p>

        <p>- The building in question is already a very bulky building.  These antennas will be unsightly and not aesthetically pleasing.</p>

        <p>- Verizon told the neighbors that the fans, which will be installed, would not make any more noise than regular traffic.</p>

        <p>- No one can guarantee her and her neighbors that there will not be any health affects.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Barbara Janeff</font></p>

        <p>- The problem she has with these antennas and this proposal is that when one is installed, it will be cause for other carriers to come and install their antennas, creating an antenna farm.</p>

        <p>- This will cause a disruption in people's lives.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Kenneth Thompson</font></p>

        <p>- He lives on the top floor of the proposed building.</p>

        <p>- It is outrageous that something like this would be proposed in a residential neighborhood.</p>

        <p>- He is concerned with the health hazards.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Madeline Camisa - Committee for Antenna-Free Marina</font></p>

        <p>- She is opposed to this installation.</p>

        <p>- The carrier already has two cell sites in the Marina.</p>

        <p>- These sites should provide more than adequate coverage to the area.</p>

        <p>- According to a survey, 90% of cell phone users were very satisfied; of these 18% were Verizon users.</p>

        <p>- Please reject this proposal.</p>

        <p>- Who would have known that when the church was built, it would be such a desirable location for cell phone antennas?</p>

        <p>- They will be improving their services to the community.</p>

        <p>- The extra income that comes is maintaining vital services of the church.</p>

        <p>- She lives opposite the tower of Lincoln Park Church.</p>

        <p>- She does not understand why the City needs more antennas.</p>

        <p>- There have been about 6,000 signatures of residents who are opposed the antennas.</p>

        <p>- She is afraid that this location will become an antenna farm.</p>

        <p>- She has seen people using their cell phone quite well.</p>

        <p>- There have too many continuances and that has been a disadvantage to the neighborhood.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Minako Sakurai</font></p>

        <p>- Her bedroom overlooks the church.</p>

        <p>- She and her neighbors oppose the installation.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will deny this application because it is not necessary. The antennas are not compatible with the neighborhood.  The location of the building is too close to schools and senior centers.  The antennas will also lower the property value of the surrounding homes.  There has not been adequate notice of this project.</p>

        <p><font class="heading2">(-) Rose Wang</font></p>

        <p>- Her neighbors have opposed any antennas in the area.</p>

        <p>- She would like to have the Commission disapprove this application because there have been many changes to the project and this causes confusion to the neighbors.  Service from Cingular is very satisfactory.</p>

        <p>- She hopes that the Commission will deny this proposal.</p>

        <p>ACTION: Approved with the following amendments:  1) change the date of the approved plans from 9/26/02 to 10/07/02; 2) make minor date changes within the final motion to make it consistent with the case report and summary; 3) modify condition of approval #8 to read &quot;The Project Sponsor <u>or property owner </u>shall remove any antennas or equipment that has been out of service for a continuous period of six months <u>or otherwise abandoned</u>.
