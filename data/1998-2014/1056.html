Because they needed four (4) votes to overturn the Commission, their vote resulted in the Commission's decision being upheld.<br><br>Re:  144 Eddy Street <br>- This proposal is a residential hotel that had been vacant for 20 years.  The project sponsor took out permits to renovate the hotel and never informed the department that it had been vacant.  The zoning would not allow a tourist hotel.<br>- The ZA determined that the tourist hotel had been abandoned and that it could be used as a residential hotel.<br>- The Board upheld him +3 -2.  This is in the North of Market Special Use District.  It was an important victory for the preservation of affordable housing--and the most important kind of affordable housing in many ways because it is single room occupancy hotels that are affordable to the lowest income levels.<br><br>RE:  1600 Mission Street<br>- There is a rotating sign there.<br>- The ZA determined that the permits were unclear.  An entire billboard that rotates is not permitted under the code.

The revisions to the original project and associated environmental effects are set out in the Summary of Comments and Responses &ndash; Section B. The 37,860 sq.ft. site contains an existing surface parking lot with landscaping which is used by the adjacent Wells Fargo Data Center.  The revised project would contain about 600 hotel rooms along with ancillary support uses such as meeting rooms, restaurants, and retail space (the originally proposed 60 to 70 residential condominiums have been eliminated). The hotel entryway would be on Howard St.  There are three loading docks planned with entrances from Fifth Street.  The site is located in the South of Market area within the C-3-S (Downtown Commercial Support) District and the 160-F Height and Bulk District.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preliminary Recommendation:  Certify Environmental Impact Report.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOTE:  The public hearing on the Draft EIR is closed.

The proposed project is the demolition and replacement of some of the existing facilities at the Laguna Honda Hospital and Rehabilitation Center, located on the western slopes of Twin Peaks in central San Francisco, and additional site improvements.  The project includes: 1) demolition of all existing hospital facilities except the front wings of the Main Hospital Building; 2) construction of four new hospital buildings; 3) construction of an assisted living facility; and 4) expansion of existing outpatient programs and services.  The new buildings plus the retained building area would total about 987,000 gross square feet (gsf) (approximately 282,500 gsf more than the existing building area) and would accommodate 1,200 hospital beds (about 135 more beds than are provided at the existing hospital), plus 140 assisted living beds.  The new hospital buildings would range from 4 to 7 stories tall, with heights up to about 86.5 feet.  A total of 655 off-street parking spaces would be provided, an increase of 52 spaces above existing capacity.  Off-street loading facilities would be consolidated into 11 loading spaces, about half the existing supply.  The project site, which encompasses most of Assessor&rsquo;s Block 2842, Lot 7, is zoned P (Public Use) and is within two height and bulk districts:  80-D and OS (Open Space).  The project may require a Zoning Map Amendment and a General Plan Amendment, and would require Conditional Use authorization.  The 62-acre hospital campus, which is owned by the City and County of San Francisco, has been determined to be eligible for the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) as an historic district and contains two buildings that appear eligible for NRHP listing as individually significant.
