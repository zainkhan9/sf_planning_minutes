<p>  11.  97.470E   (NAVARRETE)
<p>       <u>475 BRANNAN STREET - PUBLIC HEARING ON THE DRAFT
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT</u>,  The proposal is to renovate, seismically
strengthen, and expand an existing office building (former warehouse) at 475
Brannan Street, between Third and Fourth Streets (Assessor's Block 3787, lot
31), with addition of parking. The project would add two stories to an existing
two-story-plus-basement building, increasing floor area from approximately
213,500 gross square feet (gsf) to about 245,500 gsf.  Office space would
increase from 180,000 gsf to 241,000 gsf, and a portion of the ground floor
would contain approximately 2,500 gsf of retail space.  An existing 71,000 sq.ft.
basement would be converted to a parking garage for about 160 vehicles. 
Off-street loading would be provided through a new loading dock constructed
behind the building and accessible from Brannan Street via a private on-site
alley.  The project would require a rezoning of the existing 50-foot height limit to
65 feet to permit construction of the 58-foot-tall project.  The rezoning must be
approved by the Planning Commission and the Board of Supervisors.  This
project is located in an SSO (Service Secondary Office) zoning district.

<p><strong><u> </u>      Budget outcome at BOS Finance Committee to this point:
The
Committee recommended that the Department be allowed to keep its
funding--at least instructed  the Budget Analyst (Mr. Harvey Rose) to
meet the Department half way.  Original proposal was $8,877,368.
The Board approved $8,688,187 -- 20% over last year (or current
fiscal year budget).  This means a slight increase in fees and an
approximate $284,000 additional General Fund increase, allowing the
Department to fill four new positions -- 2 in Environmental Review
and 2 in Neighborhood Planning.</strong>
