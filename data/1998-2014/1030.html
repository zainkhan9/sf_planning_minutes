    <ul><ul><p><u>HOUSING ELEMENT OF THE GENERAL PLAN</u> - Continued public hearing on the proposed update and amendments to the <i>General Plan</i> put forth in the <i>Housing Element Final Draft for Public Review</i> released February 10, 2003. Proposed revisions will update and amend the <i>Residence Element</i> adopted in 1990 and include an assessment of housing needs, new policies to increase housing production such as higher residential densities along appropriate transit corridors and downtown neighborhoods; encouragement of housing development in neighborhood commercial districts; reconsideration of residential parking requirements; and policies supporting construction of new family housing. <i>The Housing Element Final Draft for Public Review</i> incorporated modifications based on comments and other feedback received by the Planning Department on the first draft published in August 2002.</p>

    <p>Preliminary Recommendation: No Action Requested.</p>

    <p>(First Public hearing held on May 1, 2003; continued to second public hearing held on June 5, 2003.) </p>

        <ul><ul><p>(Continued from Regular Meeting of June 12, 2003)</p>

    </ul></ul><p>SPEAKER(S):</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Dave Bishol - Westwood Highlands Organization</font></p>

    <p>- He submitted a letter from the West of Twin Peaks who is against the proposed Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- This document is fictitious. </p>

    <p>- He asked the Commission to reject this document.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">John Alley</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- He asked the Commission to pass this Housing Element because people need affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">John Lucas</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- He hopes that the Commission will pass the Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Phillip Melton</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- His life is continually threatened because of his living conditions.</p>

    <p>- He has been turned down for loans to purchase a house.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alfonso Texador</font></p>

    <p>- He cannot afford the rent in a tiny room where he lives.</p>

    <p>- The situation is intolerable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jessie Turner</font></p>

    <p>- He is homeless right now.</p>

    <p>- He hopes that the Commission will approve this Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Natalie Woods</font></p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission will approve this Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alfonso Moore</font></p>

    <p>- He is barely making it with the income he receives.</p>

    <p>- People need clean environments where they can live.</p>

    <p>- Locations for affordable housing need to be looked at.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Carol Warmsley</font></p>

    <p>- She has been homeless and has lived in SRO hotels.</p>

    <p>- It is hard to get by on very little money.</p>

    <p>- Affordable housing is a blessing.</p>

    <p>- People are homeless for different reasons yet most of them live this way because housing is not affordable.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Francisco Centurion - Russian Hill Neighbors</font></p>

    <p>- He thinks that there are a lot of things that are too loose.  Until they are resolved there is no housing element.</p>

    <p>- One of the issues is the section on affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- He is concerned about the transit corridors (Van Ness, Geary, Mission, etc).</p>

    <p>- There are transit corridors that have not been included and they would make a great difference.</p>

    <p>- He would like to know the definition of transit corridors and which ones will be included.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Roger (did not state last name)</font></p>

    <p>- He has lived in an SRO hotel for many years.</p>

    <p>- His rent has not changed for a long time.</p>

    <p>- He has gone through a lot of turmoil at the SRO hotel where he lives.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eferina Niarcines</font></p>

    <p>- She would like to know more about housing since his situation is getting more difficult.</p>

    <p>- She will have to move out from where she lives.</p>

    <p>- She hopes the Commission will include affordable housing in this Housing Element.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Remedios Baltica</font></p>

    <p>- She is concerned with affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Judy Berkowitz - Coalition for Neighborhoods</font></p>

    <p>- There are people that are not speaking on the housing element.</p>

    <p>- She would like people to stick to the subject and the hearing would move along more smoothly.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Maria Sousa - Richmond District Association</font></p>

    <p>- She thanked the Commissioners for taking a close look at the draft.</p>

    <p>- The actual policy languages have not really changed.</p>

    <p>- The word affordable has not been included in the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- This draft with Commissioners comments was not available until Thursday afternoon.</p>

    <p>- Copies were not available at the library either.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Commission will allow for further public review.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Barbara Austin</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in the Richmond District.</p>

    <p>- It is hard to get through.</p>

    <p>- How does one solve the housing shortage and meet the needs of people.</p>

    <p>- She asked the Commission not to close public comment.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">D. Allen - Sixth Street Agenda</font></p>

    <p>- The real focus is on the living conditions of many people who cannot afford a decent place to live.</p>

    <p>- By approving and passing the Housing Element it will encourage the construction of affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Deforest Woods</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- He is thankful that he has a roof.  To have your own key means a lot to him.</p>

    <p>- More affordable housing is important for people who want to improve their lives.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Penelope Clark</font></p>

    <p>- There seems to be missing the ratio of new housing and new office development.</p>

    <p>- When there are a lot of new jobs, housing goes through the roof.</p>

    <p>- It is important to consider new office space, which will demand new housing.</p>

    <p>- Housing at 8<sup>th</sup> and Market would be a great location.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Sharlot Mac</font></p>

    <p>- How can the Commission and the Department run the Housing Element without funds and the budget constraints?</p>

    <p>- She suggests that the full weight of this department be to develop the South East Sector.</p>

    <p>- The neighborhoods are a stable element of San Francisco.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Bernie Choden - San Francisco Tomorrow</font></p>

    <p>- He believes that this draft still is a document with major shortcomings.  While the Commission soon will probably approve the Housing Element, he suggests, at least, that there be stronger, clearer enforceable policies in these subjects of concern:</p>

    <p>- Establish a central authority for facilitating affordable housing, especially for larger households.</p>

    <p>- Provide adequate capital budgeting for increased housing density especially with regard to available resources.</p>

    <p>- Provide neighborhood holing capacity analysis in devising density.</p>

    <p>- Provide mitigations for reduced residential parking.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ellis McDonald</font></p>

    <p>- People will fill the streets to show how important it is to have affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Rex Swaisney</font></p>

    <p>- There are some areas that he would like to address: instead of monitoring rehabs, take action on rehabs.  There are a lot of housing units that need rehabilitation.</p>

    <p>- It is important to have monitoring so that if there is a plan some action could be taken.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Grace Calagos</font></p>

    <p>- There is a coalition to amend and adopt the housing element.</p>

    <p>- There is a failure to address affordable family housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Russel Burman - Mobile Outreach Support Team</font></p>

    <p>- The plan really needs to respond to people who truly need affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- There are people who are homeless and are interested in employment and a decent place to live.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Cyndy Mendoza - Mission Hiring Hall - SOMA</font></p>

    <p>- She urges the Commission to encourage development for affordable housing and to adopt the Housing Element now.</p>

    <p>- The lack of stable housing negatively impacts local employment.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Christopher Peterson</font></p>

    <p>- He encourages development in all transit corridors.</p>

    <p>- The Commission needs to look at requiring transit impact fees, require in lieu fees, etc.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Jennifer Chow Green</font></p>

    <p>- The housing element does not really define what a transit corridor is.</p>

    <p>- The changes proposed in the housing element without funding will lead to more problems</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eileen Bogan - SPEAK</font></p>

    <p>- Many people have not been able to review the Commissioner's comments.</p>

    <p>- The concept of transit corridors is deeply flawed in the Housing Element.</p>

    <p>- Should capacity in MUNI be increased?</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Kim Koumbs</font></p>

    <p>- He cannot afford to live in this City anymore.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Eia Peno</font></p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Housing Element will be adopted.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alisha Rochell - Visitation Valley</font></p>

    <p>- She would like to have the Commission approve the Housing Element plan.</p>

    <p>- She was born and raised in San Francisco and does not want to move away.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Valerie Capeheart</font></p>

    <p>- Affordable housing keeps being delayed and delayed.</p>

    <p>- High-rises for rich people will be trying to bring too many people into San Francisco.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Timothy Jones</font></p>

    <p>- He lives in an SRO hotel.</p>

    <p>- It is difficult for people to live in these hotels because they are scared.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Scott Ferguson</font></p>

    <p>- He was homeless for 15 years and is now lucky to live in a unit.</p>

    <p>- Low-income housing should be located throughout the city.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Elsa Gualive - PODER</font></p>

    <p>- She lives in the Mission District.</p>

    <p>- She recommends changing the implementation policy because there should be a larger percentage of family units.  This should be changed and passed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Vicente (did not state last name)</font></p>

    <p>- He is a student and is having a hard time because his father makes less than average and cannot afford to send him to school.</p>

    <p>- A person needs to make at least $37.37 an hour to be able to pay for affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Evelyn Ruiz</font></p>

    <p>- If she didn't live where she lives, she would not be able to pay the rent because her father is on disability and her and her mother cannot afford to pay the rent.</p>

    <p>- There are too many things he would like to comment about the Housing Element but there is little time.</p>

    <p>- A Housing Element is great for the rich and wealthy.</p>

    <p>- San Francisco has become a City for the very poor or the very rich.</p>

She would like to see more explicit wording around the incentives for private developers to include affordable housing ownership units in their private developments for the 80% to 120% median income families.  That would free up the public funds to target the low income family needs.</p>

    <p>- The needs assessment of the Housing Element gives very explicit wording around facilitating the permit process for private developers who do include affordable housing.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Ken Chow - Chinatown Community Center</font></p>

    <p>- There is a housing crisis but if you ask someone the answer will depend on if they have money or not.  If someone is rich, they will say that there is no housing crisis.  If you live on the street, they will say that there is a housing crisis.</p>

    <p>- The City needs affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- The Housing Element needs some clarity related to key policies and objectives emphasizing affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- Many of the stories while compelling, are not pertinent to the subject at hand.</p>

    <p>- It is important not to lose the character of San Francisco.</p>

    <p>- Seismic stability is very important on all buildings throughout the City.  If there were high-density housing in the Marina in 1989, there would have been more casualties.</p>

    <p>- She hopes that the Housing Element is passed.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Angel Martinez</font></p>

    <p>- It is unfortunate that people are living out in the streets.  These people should be given the opportunity to have access to affordable housing.</p>

    <p>- The Commission can help society and help make this a better place.</p>

    <p><font class="heading2">Alice Picas</font></p>
